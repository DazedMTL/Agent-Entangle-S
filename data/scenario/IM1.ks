After school.[pcm]

Since our homeroom teacher, Hanzakura-sensei, was busy with miscellaneous tasks,[r]I ended up attending the HR meeting as a substitute.[pcm]

Attendance is not particularly necessary.[l][er]
It seems that the class representative is mainly in charge[r]of leading the HR meeting, and there are no special[r]instructions from Hanzakura-sensei.[l][er]
I just have to participate and witness the class being dismissed today.[pcm]

I don't remember if it was the same when I was a student, but compared to[r]standing at the podium, there's nothing more relaxing.[pcm]

I watched as the students, who had finished their day of classes, were not so[r]much relaxed as they were slack, in the corner of the classroom.[pcm]

The gaze naturally turns towards Emma.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_楽.png"]

She is preparing to go home while chatting with her classmates.[pcm]

This is a normal girl of her age, who doesn't show any signs[r]of being reserved when talking or being approached.[l][er]
Her choice of words is normal, as well as her gestures and[r]actions...[l][er]
Besides her healthy tanned skin, which speaks of her liveliness, she is just an[r]ordinary girl you can find anywhere.[pcm]

[人物消去]

The Emma in my memory is different.[l][er]
I have a feeling that she might be different.[pcm]

She was rather quiet and shy, and when she was at home, she would always stick[r]close to her parents.[pcm]

Since both of her parents died...[l][er]
I feel like she cried all the time.[l][er]
She would become withdrawn and cling to me...[pcm]

It was unbearably annoying to me...[pcm]

…[pcm][人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

[女子生徒]
Take your seats for the HR meeting from the beginning.[pcm]

The student standing beside the podium raises their voice...[l][er]
Perhaps this child is the class representative.[l][er]
However, their loosened tie and less than polite choice of[r]words.[l][er]
They don't seem like a typical class representative.[pcm]

[人物消去]

Emma also stops chatting and quietly takes her seat.[pcm]

The class representative watches as the other students[r]return to their seats and asks a nearby student, Was 〇〇[r]absent?[l][er]
or something similar to confirm.[l][er]
Naru doesn't seem very interested in that, but they are still diligently doing[r]their job as the class representative.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

[女子生徒]
Since it looks like everyone is here, can we end it?[l][er]
Is there anything else?[pcm]

[人物消去]

The class representative confirms with a loud voice, and voices from all around[r]respond with Naru or Not here.[pcm]

I hadn't heard anything in particular from Mr.[l][er]
Hazakura, so I had a feeling that our class didn't have any significant issues.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】女子生徒(制服).png"]

[女子生徒]
Since there's nothing anyway, let's finish quickly, Kanochan.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

[カノ]
Stop making noise and behave. Satomi-sensei, is there nothing in particular?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_喜2.png"]

Startled by the sudden attention directed towards me, I nod[r]with a smile.[l][er]
... I wonder if this child is called Kano.[l][er]
I don't know if it's their first name or last name, but it's an unusual-sounding[r]name.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

[カノ]
Well then, let's disband for today.[l][er]
Thank you for standing and bowing.[pcm]

[人物消去]

The student representative, Kano-san, quickly finished the[r]HR without waiting for the students to stand or bow.[l][er]
Judging from the reactions of the surrounding students, it seemed to be the[r]usual routine, and they began to leave their seats as if it were natural.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】男子生徒.png"]

[男子生徒]
See you tomorrow, Satomi-sensei.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】女子生徒(制服).png"]

[女子生徒]
See you later, Sensei![pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_やあ！.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM1s__01.ogg"]
Okay, good job. Take care on your way home.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_普通.png"]

My gaze is constantly directed towards Emma as I return[r]greetings to the students.[l][er]
... She seems to be getting ready for club activities.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM1e__01.ogg"]
I don't really like being stared at...[pcm]

[人物消去]

Only Emma and I were left in the classroom for a few minutes.[pcm]

The first one to break the silence was Emma, and her expression clearly showed[r]deep annoyance.[pcm]

I expected the reaction, but I wonder why it still feels somewhat uncomfortable.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM1s__02.ogg"]
Hey, um... There's something I want to ask.[pcm]

[人物消去]

How should I ask... Honestly, even at this stage, my words get stuck.[pcm]

I can't help but confirm something that has been bothering[r]me all along.[l][er]
It's the suspicion that Sakagawa was bothering Emma.[pcm]

I honestly think, what's the point of asking?[l][er]
Confirming something like this won't improve the situation[r]in any way.[l][er]
If anything, there's a possibility that it could even make things worse.[pcm]

When I was asked to participate in HR today, the first thing I thought was that[r]I could talk to Emma and confirm what Sakagawa had said.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM1s__03.ogg"]
Um... well... you know about Sakagawa-sensei, right?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_不機嫌.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM1e__02.ogg"]
Of course. Because he's the club advisor.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM1s__04.ogg"]
Um... well... I heard something, but about him and you, um...[pcm]

[人物消去]

Even though I think, 'What's the point of asking?[l][er]
', in the end, it becomes words.[l][er]
Even though it becomes words, I don't know how to ask, so my[r]words get stuck.[l][er]
I also don't know what expression I have on my face.[pcm]

Emma, with her eyes slightly wandering, let out a big sigh as if to say, Ah, I'm[r]so tired of dealing with this confused me.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_不機嫌.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM1e__03.ogg"]
We're dating. Are you going to lecture me?[pcm]

[人物消去]

Because it was such a clear answer, I couldn't say 'no' or[r]'yes'.[l][er]
I didn't have a plan for what to do after confirming it, so it's natural that it[r]turned out like this.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀2.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM1s__05.ogg"]
In that case... um, but you see...[l][er]
well...[pcm]

[人物消去]

Saying that much... I avert my gaze from Emma.[l][er]
What am I really doing... Why did I even confirm something[r]like this.[l][er]
Even though I knew it wouldn't change anything...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM1s__06.ogg"]
I'm sorry.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_不機嫌.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM1e__04.ogg"]
It's nothing.[pcm]

[人物消去]
[効果音 file = "【SE】引き戸.ogg"]

The sound of a short response and Emma standing up can be[r]heard.[l][er]
Footsteps, the sound of the classroom door opening,[r]closing...[l][er]
Silence.[pcm]

Only I was left in the classroom alone.[pcm]

[効果音ストップ]
[音楽フェードアウト time = "1000"]

…[pcm][人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM1s__07.ogg"]
Sigh...[pcm]

[人物消去]

I squeezed out all the air from my lungs and sat down on the[r]spot.[l][er]
... This is the worst. What have I done?[pcm]

It's not a topic that can turn into anything but the worst[r]atmosphere, no matter how you think about it.[l][er]
I don't have the slightest desire to somehow get along with Emma at this point,[r]but that doesn't mean I want to make the atmosphere even worse.[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】疑惑.ogg"]
[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_しまった….png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM1s__08.ogg"]
But... it was clear that there is a personal connection between Sakagawa and[r]that girl.[pcm]

[人物消去]

It seems certain, judging from Emma's behavior, that there[r]is a relationship involving romantic feelings.[l][er]
... And it is likely to be one-sided on Emma's part.[l][er]
Sakagawa... that man is most likely manipulating and playing around with Emma.[pcm]

This is what it means... In other words, it means that Emma was not targeted by[r]Otsu or Sakagawa because I infiltrated this school.[pcm]

When Sakagawa compared the body and cuddling sensation with Emma, I felt a sense[r]of discomfort somewhere.[pcm]

The day after Otsu told me I'll take Emma hostage is when I[r]was pushed down by Sakagawa in the old school building.[l][er]
If it was done to pressure me with sanctions and threats, misleading Emma, it's[r]too sudden of a development.[pcm]

If we think naturally, it is likely that Sakagawa had a relationship with Emma[r]before, regardless of my existence.[pcm]

The relationship between the four missing students and Sakagawa is unknown so[r]far, but judging from the situation, it is most likely that Sakagawa was[r]conducting some kind of manipulation using his position as the swimming club[r]advisor.[pcm]

In other words... Emma was targeted from the beginning.[l][er]
By Otsu and Sakagawa. While I was standing by, that girl[r]became the 'fifth person.[l][er]
' That is the harsh reality.[pcm]

If I stay silent and listen to what they say, it means that[r]the claim of Emma being the only one safe is all a lie...[l][er]
Unless I do something, both Emma and I will be crushed by them...!![pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_怒2.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM1s__09.ogg"]
Damn... Damn it...[pcm]

[人物消去]

I sat down and vomited over and over again.[l][er]
What should I do... What should I do...!![pcm]
