After school.[pcm]

"Since our homeroom teacher, Hanzakura-sensei, was busy with[r]
miscellaneous tasks, I ended up attending the HR meeting as[r]
a substitute."[pcm]

Attendance is not particularly necessary. It seems that the[r]
class representative is mainly in charge of leading the HR[r]
meeting, and there are no special instructions from[r]
Hanzakura-sensei. I just have to participate and witness the[r]
class being dismissed today.[pcm]

"I don't remember if it was the same when I was a student,[r]
but compared to standing at the podium, there's nothing more[r]
relaxing."[pcm]

I watched as the students, who had finished their day of[r]
classes, were not so much relaxed as they were slack, in the[r]
corner of the classroom.[pcm]

The gaze naturally turns towards Emma.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_楽.png"]

She is preparing to go home while chatting with her[r]
classmates.[pcm]

This is a normal girl of her age, who doesn't show any signs[r]
of being reserved when talking or being approached. Her[r]
choice of words is normal, as well as her gestures and[r]
actions... Besides her healthy tanned skin, which speaks of[r]
her liveliness, she is just an ordinary girl you can find[r]
anywhere.[pcm]

[人物消去]

"The Emma in my memory is different. I have a feeling that[r]
she might be different."[pcm]

She was rather quiet and shy, and when she was at home, she[r]
would always stick close to her parents.[pcm]

Since both of her parents died... I feel like she cried all[r]
the time. She would become withdrawn and cling to me...[pcm]

It was unbearably annoying to me...[pcm]

…[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

[女子生徒]
"Take your seats for the HR meeting from the beginning."[pcm]

The student standing beside the podium raises their voice...[r]
Perhaps this child is the class representative. However,[r]
their loosened tie and less than polite choice of words.[r]
They don't seem like a typical class representative.[pcm]

[人物消去]

Emma also stops chatting and quietly takes her seat.[pcm]

The class representative watches as the other students[r]
return to their seats and asks a nearby student, "Was 〇〇[r]
absent?" or something similar to confirm. Naru doesn't seem[r]
very interested in that, but they are still diligently doing[r]
their job as the class representative.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

[女子生徒]
"Since it looks like everyone is here, can we end it? Is[r]
there anything else?"[pcm]

[人物消去]

The class representative confirms with a loud voice, and[r]
voices from all around respond with "Naru" or "Not here."[pcm]

I hadn't heard anything in particular from Mr. Hazakura, so[r]
I had a feeling that our class didn't have any significant[r]
issues.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】女子生徒(制服).png"]

[女子生徒]
"Since there's nothing anyway, let's finish quickly,[r]
Kanochan."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

[カノ]
"Stop making noise and behave. Satomi-sensei, is there[r]
nothing in particular?"[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_喜2.png"]

Startled by the sudden attention directed towards me, I nod[r]
with a smile. ...I wonder if this child is called Kano. I[r]
don't know if it's their first name or last name, but it's[r]
an unusual-sounding name.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

[カノ]
"Well then, let's disband for today. Thank you for standing[r]
and bowing."[pcm]

[人物消去]

The student representative, Kano-san, quickly finished the[r]
HR without waiting for the students to stand or bow. Judging[r]
from the reactions of the surrounding students, it seemed to[r]
be the usual routine, and they began to leave their seats as[r]
if it were natural.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】男子生徒.png"]

[男子生徒]
"See you tomorrow, Satomi-sensei."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】女子生徒(制服).png"]

[女子生徒]
"See you later, Sensei!"[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_やあ！.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM1s__01.ogg"]
"Okay, good job. Take care on your way home."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_普通.png"]

My gaze is constantly directed towards Emma as I return[r]
greetings to the students. ...She seems to be getting ready[r]
for club activities.[pcm]

"I don't really like being stared at..."[pcm]

[人物消去]

Only Emma and I were left in the classroom for a few[r]
minutes.[pcm]

"The first one to break the silence was Emma, and her[r]
expression clearly showed deep annoyance."[pcm]

I expected the reaction, but I wonder why it still feels[r]
somewhat uncomfortable.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM1s__02.ogg"]
"Hey, um... There's something I want to ask."[pcm]

[人物消去]

How should I ask... Honestly, even at this stage, my words[r]
get stuck.[pcm]

I can't help but confirm something that has been bothering[r]
me all along. It's the suspicion that Sakagawa was bothering[r]
Emma.[pcm]

"I honestly think, what's the point of asking? Confirming[r]
something like this won't improve the situation in any way.[r]
If anything, there's a possibility that it could even make[r]
things worse."[pcm]

When I was asked to participate in HR today, the first thing[r]
I thought was that I could talk to Emma and confirm what[r]
Sakagawa had said.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM1s__03.ogg"]
"Um... well... you know about Sakagawa-sensei, right?"[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_不機嫌.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM1e__02.ogg"]
"Of course. Because he's the club advisor."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM1s__04.ogg"]
"Um... well... I heard something, but about him and you,[r]
um..."[pcm]

[人物消去]

"Even though I think, 'What's the point of asking?', in the[r]
end, it becomes words. Even though it becomes words, I don't[r]
know how to ask, so my words get stuck. I also don't know[r]
what expression I have on my face."[pcm]

Emma, with her eyes slightly wandering, let out a big sigh[r]
as if to say, "Ah, I'm so tired of dealing with this[r]
confused me."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_不機嫌.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM1e__03.ogg"]
"We're dating. Are you going to lecture me?"[pcm]

[人物消去]

"Because it was such a clear answer, I couldn't say 'no' or[r]
'yes'. I didn't have a plan for what to do after confirming[r]
it, so it's natural that it turned out like this."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀2.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM1s__05.ogg"]
"In that case... um, but you see... well..."[pcm]

[人物消去]

"Saying that much... I avert my gaze from Emma. What am I[r]
really doing... Why did I even confirm something like this.[r]
Even though I knew it wouldn't change anything..."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM1s__06.ogg"]
"I'm sorry."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_不機嫌.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM1e__04.ogg"]
"It's nothing."[pcm]

[人物消去]
[効果音 file = "【SE】引き戸.ogg"]

The sound of a short response and Emma standing up can be[r]
heard. Footsteps, the sound of the classroom door opening,[r]
closing... Silence.[pcm]

Only I was left in the classroom alone.[pcm]

[効果音ストップ]
[音楽フェードアウト time = "1000"]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM1s__07.ogg"]
"Sigh..."[pcm]

[人物消去]

I squeezed out all the air from my lungs and sat down on the[r]
spot. ...This is the worst. What have I done?[pcm]

It's not a topic that can turn into anything but the worst[r]
atmosphere, no matter how you think about it. I don't have[r]
the slightest desire to somehow get along with Emma at this[r]
point, but that doesn't mean I want to make the atmosphere[r]
even worse.[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】疑惑.ogg"]
[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_しまった….png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM1s__08.ogg"]
"But... it was clear that there is a personal connection[r]
between Sakagawa and that girl."[pcm]

[人物消去]

It seems certain, judging from Emma's behavior, that there[r]
is a relationship involving romantic feelings. ...And it is[r]
likely to be one-sided on Emma's part. Sakagawa... that man[r]
is most likely manipulating and "playing around" with Emma.[pcm]

This is what it means... In other words, it means that Emma[r]
was not targeted by Otsu or Sakagawa because "I infiltrated[r]
this school."[pcm]

When Sakagawa compared the body and cuddling sensation with[r]
Emma, I felt a sense of discomfort somewhere.[pcm]

The day after Otsu told me "I'll take Emma hostage" is when[r]
I was pushed down by Sakagawa in the old school building. If[r]
it was done to pressure me with sanctions and threats,[r]
misleading Emma, it's too sudden of a development.[pcm]

If we think naturally, it is likely that Sakagawa had a[r]
relationship with Emma before, regardless of my existence.[pcm]

The relationship between the four missing students and[r]
Sakagawa is unknown so far, but judging from the situation,[r]
it is most likely that Sakagawa was conducting some kind of[r]
manipulation using his position as the swimming club[r]
advisor.[pcm]

"In other words... Emma was targeted from the beginning. By[r]
Otsu and Sakagawa. While I was standing by, that girl became[r]
the 'fifth person.' That is the harsh reality."[pcm]

"If I stay silent and listen to what they say, it means that[r]
the claim of Emma being the only one safe is all a lie...[r]
Unless I do something, both Emma and I will be crushed by[r]
them...!!"[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_怒2.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM1s__09.ogg"]
"Damn... Damn it..."[pcm]

I sat down and vomited over and over again. What should I[r]
do... What should I do...!![pcm]
