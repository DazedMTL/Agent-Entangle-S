No way, I totally thought Satomi-sensei was married.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_楽2.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM3s__01.ogg"]
No, no, it's not like that... And you shouldn't ask those[r]kinds of things.[l][er]
Normally, that would be an instant out, so be careful, okay?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】男子生徒.png"]

[男子生徒]
No way...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】女子生徒(制服).png"]

[女子生徒]
I told you to stop, didn't I? Seriously, you're so creepy with comments like[r]that.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】男子生徒.png"]

[男子生徒]
Say it first! Don't talk about the teacher's current situation, no, no...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_やれやれ.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM3s__02.ogg"]
Yes, yes... It's not good to ask those kinds of things to Hazakura-sensei[r]either.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】女子生徒(制服).png"]

[女子生徒]
I got punched after asking in the first semester.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】男子生徒.png"]

[男子生徒]
Hey... why are you exposing it!?[pcm]

[人物消去]

HR is over, and I've been approached by students more often.[l][er]
The majority of them are male students...[l][er]
It may sound conceited, but at my age, I guess I'm the type of beautiful woman[r]that they find interesting.[pcm]

Honestly, I don't have the luxury to indulge in such foolish[r]conversations in my heart...[l][er]
but there's a part of me that feels relieved in this casual exchange without any[r]tension.[pcm]

Teacher... a teacher, huh. Just pretending and acting like that, but maybe there[r]is a way of living like that too.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

[夏野]
Satomi-sensei, can I talk to you for a moment?[pcm]

Unexpectedly, I was called out from a different direction,[r]and I naturally looked up.[l][er]
There, I saw the class representative...[l][er]
I think her name was Kano-san?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】女子生徒(制服).png"]

[女子生徒]
What's wrong, Kano-chan?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

[夏野]
You guys are fine. Just go away.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】男子生徒.png"]

[男子生徒]
How awful... Seriously, no talking about what happened earlier, okay!?[pcm]

[人物消去]

She forcefully disbanded the students who were talking to[r]me, coughed once, and glanced around to confirm.[l][er]
... She had a serious look on her face for some reason.[l][er]

[夏野]
It's not a story to be told out loud, so I'll keep it brief.[l][er]
If you want to talk to Uncle, go to the staff room now.[l][er]
Hurry up.[pcm]

[人物消去]

I momentarily couldn't understand Kano-san's whispered[r]words.[l][er]
Uncle...?[pcm]

But as I tried to confirm what Kano-san meant, I suddenly realized what she was[r]saying.[pcm]

Kano... Natsuno. Detective Natsuno...![l][er]
Calling him uncle, that's what it means...![pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_基本.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM3s__03.ogg"]
Thank you. I appreciate it.[pcm]

[人物消去]

I quickly left the classroom after briefly telling Kano...[l][er]
no, Natsuno-san. Right now, I need to hurry...![pcm]

[音楽フェードアウト time = "1000"]

…[pcm]… ……[pcm]… …… ………[pcm][音楽 file = "【BGM】仕事.ogg"]
[会話シーン file = "【背景】廊下(昼).png"]

Thinking as I walked towards the staff room.[pcm]

I don't understand why Natsuno-san called out to me as if[r]she sensed my predicament.[l][er]
However, it seems that she had some kind of information sharing with Detective[r]Natsuno.[pcm]

It occurs to me that the other day, Detective Natsuno was[r]suspicious about my identity and took the time to explain[r]the situation of the surveillance system in this town.[l][er]
It might not have been a coincidence.[pcm]

I don't think they understood who I really am, like Otsu and the others, but it[r]was clear that they sensed something about me, an existence that suddenly[r]appeared from the outside.[pcm]

The information provided about the surveillance cameras was,[r]in a way, a litmus test...[l][er]
to see who I really am and how I would react...[l][er]
isn't it?[pcm]

Of course, it is entirely possible that it is a trap.[l][er]
However, at the very least, Detective Natsuno is a[r]formidable enemy for Otsu and Sakagawa...[l][er]
An interfering nuisance with no common ground.[pcm]

Otsu's complaints and Sakagawa's troubles...[l][er]
based on that premise, there is coercion and violence.[l][er]
At the very least, Detective Natsuno and Otsu are at odds with each other.[pcm]

Even if I can't become their ally...[l][er]
still, the only person outside that I can have contact with right now is[r]Detective Natsuno.[pcm]

Then, there's no choice but to rely on this one point...!![pcm]

Walking slowly down the hallway, trying not to arouse suspicion, I make my way[r]to the staff room.[pcm]

[効果音 file = "【SE】引き戸.ogg"]
[会話シーン file = "【背景】職員室(昼).png"]

Opening the sliding door and entering...[l][er]
There, I saw Detective Natsuno chatting with Professor Hazakura.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】葉桜先生.png"]

[葉桜]
Oh, Satomi-sensei, good work! Sorry, I asked HR to come out.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_やあ！.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM3s__04.ogg"]
No, no, I can do this anytime...[l][er]
Natsuno-san, thank you for your hard work as well.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

When I nodded, my eyes met with Detective Natsuno.[l][er]
His tired gaze, with the corners of his eyes drooping, stared at me intently.[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
Good work. ... Satomi-sensei, would you like some tea?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】葉桜先生.png"]

[葉桜]
Eh?[pcm]

[人物消去]

Professor Hazakura widened her eyes and let out a strange[r]voice...[l][er]
but I answered shortly, saying 'Yes, please'.[pcm]

[音楽フェードアウト time = "1000"]

…[pcm]… ……[pcm]… …… ………[pcm][音楽 file = "【BGM】夏野刑事のテーマ.ogg"]
[会話シーン file = "【背景】体育館前.png"]

Same as the other day, in front of the gymnasium parking[r]lot.[l][er]
Detective Natsuno and I were sitting on top of stacked blocks, holding canned[r]coffee that we bought from a vending machine.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
I wonder if Yoko properly conveyed that information.[pcm]

[人物消去]

Detective Natsuno, while absentmindedly looking up at the[r]sky, takes a sip of canned coffee.[l][er]
... I don't quite understand what that expression means to me right now.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
She's my niece, you know. She may seem rough, but she's a[r]thoughtful girl.[l][er]
I told her to speak up if she sees the teacher in trouble.[l][er]
I'm glad it wasn't just my imagination.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM3s__05.ogg"]
Where is Natsuno-san going...[pcm]

[人物消去]

Detective Natsuno puts his index finger to his mouth as if to say Do you know[r]about me?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
Well, after all that is over. From here on, it's just me[r]talking to myself.[l][er]
So, it would be helpful if you could nod your head up and down or shake it side[r]to side as you please.[pcm]

[人物消去]

... Perhaps there is no need to worry about Otsu overhearing[r]our conversation in this place.[l][er]
It's because Otsu didn't know about the content of our[r]previous conversation...[l][er]
But still, I want to keep the conversation to a minimum, perhaps as a[r]precaution.[pcm]

Can I go along with this flow...[l][er]
Honestly, I'm confused. But as I confirmed earlier, Detective Natsuno is my last[r]hope right now.[pcm]

I have no choice but to go along with it.[pcm]

I nodded without saying a word, and Detective Natsuno responded with a small[r]yes.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
Is Satomi-sensei in a pinch right now?[pcm]

[人物消去]

Nodding.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
Is it related to the series of disappearances...[l][er]
the missing persons cases that I am involved in?[pcm]

[人物消去]

Nodding.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
Is Satomi-sensei's sister also involved in the pinch?[pcm]

[人物消去]

Nodding.[pcm]

[音楽フェードアウト time = "1000"]

I let out a deep sigh... Detective Natsuno also breathed[r]out.[l][er]
I could sense the heavy atmosphere lingering between us.[pcm]

... It was only three questions, but it was enough.[l][er]
This person is probably narrowing down the suspects in the[r]disappearance cases to some extent.[l][er]
No wonder Otsu is frustrated.[pcm]

Detective Natsuno... seems troubled, scratching his head[r]with a frustrated expression.[l][er]
He must be really inconvenienced.[l][er]
To him, I'm just a woman who brought him nothing but trouble.[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】疑惑2.ogg"]
[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
This is a continuation of my soliloquy.[l][er]
I'm the only one currently dedicated to this case.[l][er]
The higher-ups are insisting on observing...[l][er]
Well, I don't really want to say it, but it seems like[r]they're receiving various benefits.[l][er]
It's like they're getting something under the table.[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
Well, it can't be helped since it's a backwater police force[r]in the countryside...[l][er]
The main reason I diligently go to school is to at least prevent further damage[r]from occurring...[pcm]

Detective Natsuno gulped down a can of coffee.[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
I have a feeling that the people behind this incident are[r]starting to wrap up this matter.[l][er]
It's difficult to continue something like this for a long time in a country like[r]Japan, after all.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM3s__06.ogg"]
Is this matter... human trafficking?[pcm]

[人物消去]

I unintentionally blurted it out.[l][er]
Detective Natsuno widened his eyes...[l][er]
However, he nodded with a resigned expression.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
Probably, those guys intended to wrap up their work with the[r]last disappearance before summer vacation...[l][er]
Rui Asaka was the last one. Do you know Mr.[l][er]
Sakagawa? It seems he has submitted his resignation letter for the end of July.[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
It's a story about persuading Vice Principal Otsu to stay...[l][er]
Well, it seems like the plans have changed.[l][er]
... Regarding these two, does Shina-sensei also understand?[pcm]

[人物消去]

I nodded in response to the question.[l][er]
... It's too late to talk about Otsu and Sakagawa.[l][er]
What surprises me more is that Detective Natsuno has narrowed down the suspects[r]to the point of identifying individuals.[pcm]

Mr. Sakagawa, the advisor of the swimming club, is in a[r]suspicious position regarding involvement in the case, but[r]for Vice Principal Otsu's name to come up...[l][er]
The fact that that man frequently visits the police station might be some kind[r]of interference set up by Detective Natsuno.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
You might think it's too much for me to kidnap four people[r]in just six months, even if I'm leading the police on a wild[r]goose chase.[l][er]
The right thing to do would be to escape before things get[r]serious.[l][er]
But, I stayed at this school until the new semester...[l][er]
Why do you think that is?[pcm]

[人物消去]

For the first time, I was asked a clear question, and I[r]pondered...[l][er]
Although I say that, there aren't many possible reasons.[pcm]

It's true that kidnapping four people from the same scene in[r]just six months is too much.[l][er]
No matter how you think about it, it's bound to be discovered.[pcm]

In reality, I had been identified as a surveillance target[r]even before infiltrating, and while Professor Haruta is[r]still in a gray area, Otsu and Sakagawa were completely[r]black.[l][er]
... The fact that they reacted sensitively to an outsider like me and[r]immediately targeted me is evidence that they were aware of it.[pcm]

In such a situation, there are probably two main reasons for[r]staying at school.[l][er]
Either there is no choice but to stay, or there are benefits[r]to staying despite the risks.[l][er]
At least for me right now, I don't have enough information to determine the[r]former.[pcm]

However...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_不機嫌.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM3s__07.ogg"]
Is it Emma?[pcm]

[人物消去]

It became a form of answering questions with questions, but[r]Detective Natsuno nodded as if to say 'exactly'.[l][er]
I couldn't help but hang my head at his reaction...[l][er]
I didn't want it to be true.[pcm]

I see... Emma. It has been confirmed by both Sakagawa and[r]Emma herself that she already has a relationship with[r]Sakagawa.[l][er]
There was no need to make her a hostage against me, as she had already caught[r]Sakagawa's attention.[pcm]

The reason why Otsu and the others didn't leave school during summer vacation is[r]simply because there was another prey that seemed easy to take down.[pcm]

That prey is none other than Emma.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_不機嫌.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM3s__08.ogg"]
Did Natsuno-san know that Emma was being targeted?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
Yes... No, actually. I just became certain of it a little[r]while ago.[l][er]
It seems that my sister, Satomi Emma, had a close[r]relationship with the last missing person, Sakagawa Rui.[l][er]
It is true that I was cautious beforehand...[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
Excuse me, but I have investigated Professor Shijima's[r]background.[l][er]
It seems that you are also quite suspicious, but it appears[r]to be certain that you are from Yamiya.[l][er]
When I asked Professor Hata, he also told me about your sister.[pcm]

[人物消去]

I couldn't help but frown. I never expected to hear Haruta's name mentioned[r]here.[pcm]

That person is still not clearly an enemy or an ally...[l][er]
The information itself is accurate, but it's a little suspicious for them to[r]appear at this timing.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
So, I confirmed with my niece that the sister of the teacher[r]with a different last name, is close with Asaka.[l][er]
It seems that my niece and the teacher's sister have known[r]each other for quite a long time.[l][er]
They were swimming buddies in middle school, or something like that...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM3s__09.ogg"]
I can't see the conversation...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
Ah, sorry for digressing. Honestly, I'm not that interested[r]in who Shijima-sensei is, but I feel like the pieces of the[r]story are coming together too perfectly...[l][er]
Well, I just confirmed it with the previous question.[pcm]

[人物消去]

Detective Natsuno lets out a deep sigh.[l][er]
... I see, he didn't have any certainty at all, but I[r]confessed everything voluntarily.[l][er]
... Even though I'm in a desperate situation, it's a frustrating situation.[pcm]

However, with this, I have also confirmed something.[l][er]
At least Detective Natsuno is not an enemy to me in the[r]current situation...[l][er]
At least, that is the recognition I have as I face this[r]case.[l][er]
That much is clear.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
…Regarding the confirmation of the previous conversation, is it correct to say[r]that Professor Shijima is certain that his sister is in a dangerous situation?[pcm]

[人物消去]

I nod in response to the question about not asking for details, but only[r]recognition.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_不機嫌.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM3s__10.ogg"]
... I had many doubts, but I became certain with Natsuno-[r]san's words...[l][er]
If Otsu and the others are looking for the right timing to fold their work, it[r]wouldn't be strange for my sister to be eliminated at any time.[pcm]

[人物消去]

If it is true that they postponed their retreat in order to[r]capture their prey quickly, then it can be said that Emma is[r]in a very dangerous situation.[l][er]
She is in a situation where she could disappear from this town at any time.[pcm]

There is no time to spare. However, I have confirmed that I am not alone and[r]without support.[pcm]

In that case...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_しまった….png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM3s__11.ogg"]
Natsuno-san, I have something to talk about...[l][er]
If possible, I would like your cooperation.[pcm]

[人物消去]

I decided to confess to Detective Natsuno about a certain plan that I had[r]vaguely formulated in my mind.[pcm]

With his help, even if it's impossible alone, perhaps...[pcm]
