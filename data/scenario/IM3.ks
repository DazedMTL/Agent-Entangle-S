[人物消去]

HR is over, and I've been approached by students more often.[r]
The majority of them are male students... It may sound[r]
conceited, but at my age, I guess I'm the type of "beautiful[r]
woman" that they find interesting.[pcm]

Honestly, I don't have the luxury to indulge in such foolish[r]
conversations in my heart... but there's a part of me that[r]
feels relieved in this casual exchange without any tension.[pcm]

Teacher... a teacher, huh. Just pretending and "acting" like[r]
that, but maybe there is a way of living like that too.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

[夏野]
"Satomi-sensei, can I talk to you for a moment?"[pcm]

"Unexpectedly, I was called out from a different direction,[r]
and I naturally looked up. There, I saw the class[r]
representative... I think her name was Kano-san?"[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】女子生徒(制服).png"]

[女子生徒]
"What's wrong, Kano-chan?"[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

She forcefully disbanded the students who were talking to[r]

"I momentarily couldn't understand Kano-san's whispered[r]

"But as I tried to confirm what Kano-san meant, I suddenly[r]

Thinking as I walked towards the staff room.[pcm]

I don't understand why Natsuno-san called out to me as if[r]
she sensed my predicament. However, it seems that she had[r]
some kind of information sharing with Detective Natsuno.[pcm]

It occurs to me that the other day, Detective Natsuno was[r]
suspicious about my identity and took the time to explain[r]
the situation of the surveillance system in this town. It[r]
might not have been a coincidence.[pcm]

I don't think they understood who I really am, like Otsu and[r]
the others, but it was clear that they sensed something[r]
about me, an existence that suddenly appeared from the[r]
outside.[pcm]

The information provided about the surveillance cameras was,[r]
in a way, a litmus test... to see who I really am and how I[r]
would react... isn't it?[pcm]

"Of course, it is entirely possible that it is a trap.[r]
However, at the very least, Detective Natsuno is a[r]
formidable enemy for Otsu and Sakagawa... An interfering[r]
nuisance with no common ground."[pcm]

Otsu's complaints and Sakagawa's troubles... based on that[r]
premise, there is coercion and violence. At the very least,[r]
Detective Natsuno and Otsu are at odds with each other.[pcm]

Even if I can't become their ally... still, the only person[r]
outside that I can have contact with right now is Detective[r]
Natsuno.[pcm]

Then, there's no choice but to rely on this one point...!![pcm]

"Walking slowly down the hallway, trying not to arouse[r]
suspicion, I make my way to the staff room."[pcm]

[効果音 file = "【SE】引き戸.ogg"]
[会話シーン file = "【背景】職員室(昼).png"]

Opening the sliding door and entering... There, I saw[r]
Detective Natsuno chatting with Professor Hazakura.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】葉桜先生.png"]

[葉桜]
"Oh, Satomi-sensei, good work! Sorry, I asked HR to come[r]
out."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_やあ！.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM3s__04.ogg"]
"No, no, I can do this anytime... Natsuno-san, thank you for[r]
your hard work as well."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

When I nodded, my eyes met with Detective Natsuno. His tired[r]
gaze, with the corners of his eyes drooping, stared at me[r]
intently.[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
"Good work. ...Satomi-sensei, would you like some tea?"[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】葉桜先生.png"]

[葉桜]
"Eh?"[pcm]

[人物消去]

"Professor Hazakura widened her eyes and let out a strange[r]
voice... but I answered shortly, saying 'Yes, please'."[pcm]

"Same as the other day, in front of the gymnasium parking[r]
lot. Detective Natsuno and I were sitting on top of stacked[r]
blocks, holding canned coffee that we bought from a vending[r]
machine."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
"I wonder if Yoko properly conveyed that information."[pcm]

[人物消去]

Detective Natsuno, while absentmindedly looking up at the[r]
sky, takes a sip of canned coffee. ...I don't quite[r]
understand what that expression means to me right now.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
"She's my niece, you know. She may seem rough, but she's a[r]
thoughtful girl. I told her to speak up if she sees the[r]
teacher in trouble. I'm glad it wasn't just my imagination."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM3s__05.ogg"]
"Where is Natsuno-san going..."[pcm]

[人物消去]

Detective Natsuno puts his index finger to his mouth as if[r]
to say "Do you know about me?"[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
"Well, after all that is over. From here on, it's just me[r]
talking to myself. So, it would be helpful if you could nod[r]
your head up and down or shake it side to side as you[r]
please."[pcm]

[人物消去]

...Perhaps there is no need to worry about Otsu overhearing[r]
our conversation in this place. It's because Otsu didn't[r]
know about the content of our previous conversation... But[r]
still, I want to keep the conversation to a minimum, perhaps[r]
as a precaution.[pcm]

"Can I go along with this flow... Honestly, I'm confused.[r]
But as I confirmed earlier, Detective Natsuno is my last[r]
hope right now."[pcm]

I have no choice but to go along with it.[pcm]

I nodded without saying a word, and Detective Natsuno[r]
responded with a small "yes".[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
"Is Satomi-sensei in a pinch right now?"[pcm]

[人物消去]

Nodding.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
"Is it related to the series of disappearances... the[r]
missing persons cases that I am involved in?"[pcm]

[人物消去]

Nodding.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
"Is Satomi-sensei's sister also involved in the pinch?"[pcm]

[人物消去]

Nodding.[pcm]

[音楽フェードアウト time = "1000"]

I let out a deep sigh... Detective Natsuno also breathed[r]
out. I could sense the heavy atmosphere lingering between[r]
us.[pcm]

"...It was only three questions, but it was enough. This[r]
person is probably narrowing down the suspects in the[r]
disappearance cases to some extent. No wonder Otsu is[r]
frustrated."[pcm]

Detective Natsuno... seems troubled, scratching his head[r]
with a frustrated expression. He must be really[r]
inconvenienced. To him, I'm just a woman who brought him[r]
nothing but trouble.[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】疑惑2.ogg"]
[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
"This is a continuation of my soliloquy. I'm the only one[r]
currently dedicated to this case. The higher-ups are[r]
insisting on observing... Well, I don't really want to say[r]
it, but it seems like they're receiving various benefits.[r]
It's like they're getting something under the table."[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
"Well, it can't be helped since it's a backwater police[r]
force in the countryside... The main reason I diligently go[r]
to school is to at least prevent further damage from[r]
occurring..."[pcm]

Detective Natsuno gulped down a can of coffee.[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
"I have a feeling that the people behind this incident are[r]
starting to wrap up this matter. It's difficult to continue[r]
something like this for a long time in a country like Japan,[r]
after all."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM3s__06.ogg"]
"Is this matter... human trafficking?"[pcm]

[人物消去]

"I unintentionally blurted it out. Detective Natsuno widened[r]
his eyes... However, he nodded with a resigned expression."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
"Probably, those guys intended to wrap up their work with[r]
the last disappearance before summer vacation... Rui Asaka[r]
was the last one. Do you know Mr. Sakagawa? It seems he has[r]
submitted his resignation letter for the end of July."[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
"It's a story about persuading Vice Principal Otsu to[r]
stay... Well, it seems like the plans have changed.[r]
...Regarding these two, does Shina-sensei also understand?"[pcm]

[人物消去]

I nodded in response to the question. ...It's too late to[r]
talk about Otsu and Sakagawa. What surprises me more is that[r]
Detective Natsuno has narrowed down the suspects to the[r]
point of identifying individuals.[pcm]

Mr. Sakagawa, the advisor of the swimming club, is in a[r]
suspicious position regarding involvement in the case, but[r]
for Vice Principal Otsu's name to come up... The fact that[r]
that man frequently visits the police station might be some[r]
kind of interference set up by Detective Natsuno.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
"You might think it's too much for me to kidnap four people[r]
in just six months, even if I'm leading the police on a wild[r]
goose chase. The right thing to do would be to escape before[r]
things get serious. But, I stayed at this school until the[r]
new semester... Why do you think that is?"[pcm]

[人物消去]

"For the first time, I was asked a clear question, and I[r]
pondered... Although I say that, there aren't many possible[r]
reasons."[pcm]

It's true that kidnapping four people from the same scene in[r]
just six months is too much. No matter how you think about[r]
it, it's bound to be discovered.[pcm]

"In reality, I had been identified as a surveillance target[r]
even before infiltrating, and while Professor Haruta is[r]
still in a gray area, Otsu and Sakagawa were completely[r]
black. ...The fact that they reacted sensitively to an[r]
outsider like me and immediately targeted me is evidence[r]
that they were aware of it."[pcm]

In such a situation, there are probably two main reasons for[r]
staying at school. Either there is no choice but to stay, or[r]
there are benefits to staying despite the risks. At least[r]
for me right now, I don't have enough information to[r]
determine the former.[pcm]

However...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_不機嫌.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM3s__07.ogg"]
"Is it Emma?"[pcm]

[人物消去]

"It became a form of answering questions with questions, but[r]
Detective Natsuno nodded as if to say 'exactly'. I couldn't[r]
help but hang my head at his reaction... I didn't want it to[r]
be true."[pcm]

"I see... Emma. It has been confirmed by both Sakagawa and[r]
Emma herself that she already has a relationship with[r]
Sakagawa. There was no need to make her a hostage against[r]
me, as she had already caught Sakagawa's attention."[pcm]

The reason why Otsu and the others didn't leave school[r]
during summer vacation is simply because there was "another[r]
prey that seemed easy to take down."[pcm]

That prey is none other than Emma.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_不機嫌.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM3s__08.ogg"]
"Did Natsuno-san know that Emma was being targeted?"[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
"Yes... No, actually. I just became certain of it a little[r]
while ago. It seems that my sister, Satomi Emma, had a[r]
close relationship with the last missing person, Sakagawa[r]
Rui. It is true that I was cautious beforehand..."[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
"Excuse me, but I have investigated Professor Shijima's[r]
background. It seems that you are also quite suspicious, but[r]
it appears to be certain that you are from Yamiya. When I[r]
asked Professor Hata, he also told me about your sister."[pcm]

[人物消去]

I couldn't help but frown. I never expected to hear Haruta's[r]
name mentioned here.[pcm]

That person is still not clearly an enemy or an ally... The[r]
information itself is accurate, but it's a little suspicious[r]
for them to appear at this timing.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
"So, I confirmed with my niece that the sister of the[r]
teacher with a different last name, is close with Asaka. It[r]
seems that my niece and the teacher's sister have known each[r]
other for quite a long time. They were swimming buddies in[r]
middle school, or something like that..."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM3s__09.ogg"]
"I can't see the conversation..."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
"Ah, sorry for digressing. Honestly, I'm not that interested[r]
in who Shijima-sensei is, but I feel like the pieces of the[r]
story are coming together too perfectly... Well, I just[r]
confirmed it with the previous question."[pcm]

[人物消去]

Detective Natsuno lets out a deep sigh. ...I see, he didn't[r]
have any certainty at all, but I confessed everything[r]
voluntarily. ...Even though I'm in a desperate situation,[r]
it's a frustrating situation.[pcm]

"However, with this, I have also confirmed something. At[r]
least Detective Natsuno is not an enemy to me in the current[r]
situation... At least, that is the recognition I have as I[r]
face this case. That much is clear."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野刑事]
"…Regarding the confirmation of the previous conversation,[r]
is it correct to say that Professor Shijima is certain that[r]
his sister is in a dangerous situation?"[pcm]

[人物消去]

"I nod in response to the question about not asking for[r]
details, but only recognition."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_不機嫌.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM3s__10.ogg"]
"...I had many doubts, but I became certain with Natsuno-[r]
san's words... If Otsu and the others are looking for the[r]
right timing to fold their work, it wouldn't be strange for[r]
my sister to be eliminated at any time."[pcm]

[人物消去]

"If it is true that they postponed their retreat in order to[r]
capture their prey quickly, then it can be said that Emma is[r]
in a very dangerous situation. She is in a situation where[r]
she could disappear from this town at any time."[pcm]

"There is no time to spare. However, I have confirmed that I[r]
am not alone and without support."[pcm]

In that case...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_しまった….png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "IM3s__11.ogg"]
"Natsuno-san, I have something to talk about... If possible,[r]
I would like your cooperation."[pcm]

[人物消去]

I decided to confess to Detective Natsuno about a certain[r]
"plan" that I had vaguely formulated in my mind.[pcm]

With his help, even if it's impossible alone, perhaps...[pcm]
