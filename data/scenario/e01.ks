The bonus scenario at the end is for those who have seen our circle's works[r]Zanma Ryouki Nameless Queen and Zanma Batsu Hime Another Queen.[pcm]

In a corner of the rooftop of a tall building, under the dimly lit sky just[r]before sunrise.[pcm]

[イベント絵表示 file = "【イベント】アナザー.bmp"]

In front of a girl with a slightly dark skin, long hair with[r]a hint of emerald green...[l][er]
Her supple limbs reminiscent of a wild carnivorous beast...[l][er]
scattered before her are pieces of meat that have been cut up into pieces.[pcm]

The purple slime mixed with the bright red blood tells that the corpse is not[r]just human.[pcm]

... Otsu Akiharu, Vice Principal of Yamiya Academy's General[r]Department.[l][er]
More accurately, it was someone who had taken on the identity of Otsu Akiharu,[r]the 'someone'.[pcm]

The mastermind behind the series of student disappearances that resulted in four[r]victims had met their demise without ever basking in the sunlight.[pcm]

He, who has been artificially modified and is called a[r]demon, is an abnormal being.[l][er]
It is likely that this fact will never be made public.[l][er]
... The girls who slaughtered him will hunt down every last one of them.[pcm]

The girl... Another, after releasing the unfolded blade of[r]the S.[l][er]
G. Guillotine she held in her hand, reached out to the headset.[pcm]

[ゾアン]
I see, understood... Ah, thank you for your hard work...[l][er]
Yeah, that's right. Stay down there.[l][er]
I'll come pick you up soon.[pcm]

[人物消去]

The driver in the driver's seat, who answered the call from[r]Another...[l][er]
Zoaan, while gripping the steering wheel, let out a big sigh, Phew.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ゾアン.png"]

[ゾアン]
It seems that everything has been taken care of.[l][er]
As for the cleanup...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ヴァレリー.png"]

[ヴァレリー]
If possible, I would like to leave it to Goldberg.[l][er]
Is that okay? After all, we are quite busy here.[pcm]

[人物消去]

Assistant in the passenger seat...[l][er]
Valerie Novak, who serves as the coordinator of the Temperance Unit, called out[r]to the man in the rear seat through the mirror.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】払田先生.png"]

The man sitting in the rear seat without hiding his[r]displeased expression, snorted.[l][er]
It seems that he reluctantly agreed, for now.[pcm]

The well-built middle-aged... no, elderly man, with deep wrinkles between his[r]eyebrows, continues to glare at the back of Valerie and Zoaan's heads.[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】疑惑・ミステリー.ogg"]

Satomichi Haruta... Second year, regular course, Year Head at Hachimiya Academy.[pcm]

The hidden face is a member of the Information Investigation[r]Department of Goldberg Pharmaceuticals Japan Branch.[l][er]
However, this title was added a few years ago.[l][er]
He was originally a pure teacher, but Goldberg headhunted him.[pcm]

Valerie and Zoaan used to be their superiors, but for them who had fled from[r]Goldberg, he was now more of an enemy than anything else.[pcm]

[払田]
... For now, I'll express my gratitude for this matter.[l][er]
It was a case that was beyond our control.[l][er]
Although it was resolved amidst chaos, I truly feel relieved that it was[r]handled.[pcm]

[人物消去]

Valerie shrugged her shoulders at the tone of whether it was genuine or[r]sarcastic.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ヴァレリー.png"]

[ヴァレリー]
Speaking of Director Gene's private plan, using human[r]trafficking...[l][er]
Isn't it too sloppy? They even used the demon that they had kept as their pet.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】払田先生.png"]

[払田]
Tell it directly to the person themselves...[l][er]
Although it's hopeless if we don't know where that Gene went.[pcm]

[人物消去]

The disappearance and subsequent human trafficking incident[r]were planned by a man named Gene, who serves as a section[r]chief at Goldberg Pharmaceuticals.[l][er]
The perpetrators, such as Otsu and Sakagawa, were[r]essentially Gene's underlings...[l][er]
disposable pawns.[pcm]

However, they were entrusted with access rights to the[r]network of the security company under Goldberg's control,[r]which manages much of the surveillance system in Hachimiya[r]City.[l][er]
They skillfully viewed and tampered with real-time footage and video recordings.[pcm]

The success of kidnapping four female students without leaving any traces[r]behind.[pcm]

Satomichi Haruta, who originally belonged to a department[r]that controls and manages such situations, was in a[r]situation where he had no choice but to remain silent in the[r]face of the strong authority of Gene, who is the section[r]chief attached to the US headquarters.[l][er]
For him, who is a teacher by profession, this is nothing but humiliation.[pcm]

One by one, as the students continued to disappear, a[r]turning point arrived.[l][er]
... In early August, just about a month and a half ago, Section Chief Gene, who[r]had visited Hachimiya City, suddenly vanished.[pcm]

The trigger was the accident at the Goldberg-affiliated[r]facility...[l][er]
With all communication lost and the specific interference from the US[r]headquarters gone, Haruta made a gamble.[pcm]

They reported the crimes being committed within the school to the Temperance[r]Unit, with whom they had been in conflict, including the 'accident'.[pcm]

Of course, it was a serious act of betrayal towards the[r]company...[l][er]
but Haruta's regret for not being able to protect the[r]students was immense.[l][er]
He was originally a diligent and sincere teacher.[l][er]
There was no falsehood in his genuine desire to protect the students and the[r]school.[pcm]

The Temperance Unit planned the surveillance within the school based on the[r]provided information, and the arrow of choice as their agent was...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】払田先生.png"]

[払田]
... I never expected it would be Satomi-kun who came.[l][er]
It's a pity for that resilient girl.[l][er]
I didn't want to involve Emma- kun in such a terrible incident either.[pcm]

[人物消去]

The truth is, more than half of Haruta's dissatisfaction[r]stemmed from that.[l][er]
Beyond the situation of relying on enemies and traitors, he was angry about the[r]fact that they sent Satomi, who was an impressive student to Haruta, even if it[r]wasn't intentional.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ヴァレリー.png"]

[ヴァレリー]
It's as if they're saying it wouldn't matter if other women or students were[r]involved.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】払田先生.png"]

[払田]
Are you picking a fight with me?![pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ヴァレリー.png"]

[ヴァレリー]
Excuse me. ... Anyway, can we consider the debts settled as[r]promised?[l][er]
Especially regarding Queen and Another...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】払田先生.png"]

[払田]
I understand. ... I'll put in a good word with Rosie DM.[l][er]
... I was worried about you guys too.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ヴァレリー.png"]

[ヴァレリー]
I see. Well, please tell Satomi and Emma that I'm doing well too.[pcm]

[人物消去]

Understanding Valerie's cold words, Haruta answered shortly and opened the rear[r]door.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ゾアン.png"]

[ゾアン]
Shall I see you off...?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】払田先生.png"]

[払田]
I won't tolerate being picked up in the enemy's car.[pcm]

[人物消去]

Satomi Haruta, who spat out his words and stood up from his[r]seat...[l][er]
As he stepped outside the car, he noticed a girl standing with her back towards[r]him near the rear wheel.[pcm]

In the designated summer knit of the Hachimiya Academy girls' uniform, there was[r]Ide Tatsu, with long braided hair and glasses, truly fitting the description of[r]a 'student who doesn't stand out'...[pcm]

Haruta snorted and approached the student with a stern expression.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】払田先生.png"]

[払田]
…While you were there, it seems that Emma-kun was attacked[r]by 'that'.[l][er]
The Queen of the modified humans would be astonished to hear about it.[pcm]

[人物消去]

The girl... Queen, despite the obvious contempt, doesn't[r]even furrow her brow as if she's unfazed.[l][er]
However, Haruta, even though he's dealing with a student, his expression is[r]filled with even more anger.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】払田先生.png"]

[払田]
If it weren't for you, this school would have been peaceful.[l][er]
I wouldn't have had to resort to acting like a spy![l][er]
... Just graduate already and disappear from this town, you jinx!![pcm]

[人物消去]

Haruta spat out his words and walked away, anger evident in his shoulders.[pcm]

Queen is silently watching, expressionless.[pcm]

[クイーン]
[voice file = "e01q__01.ogg"]
What is that!? This is the worst...!![pcm]

The girl who got into the back seat in place of Haruta,[r]Queen, had a complete change in expression from her composed[r]demeanor just a moment ago, her face contorted in anger.[l][er]
It could be said that it was appropriate for her age, but she also had a[r]somewhat childish demeanor.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ゾアン.png"]

[ゾアン]
Did you say something?[pcm]

[人物消去]

[クイーン]
[voice file = "e01q__02.ogg"]
I was told! ... Is it my fault that Emma-kun jumped out on[r]his own and I was late to follow?![l][er]
Is it my fault!?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ヴァレリー.png"]

[ヴァレリー]
Well, well, well...[pcm]

[人物消去]

Valerie sighed softly, trying to calm down the enraged[r]Queen.[l][er]
With this, it seemed like things had settled down a bit.[pcm]

It can be said that from around June, it was a tumultuous[r]period for them.[l][er]
The environment changed, their lives changed, and even the[r]faction they belonged to changed.[l][er]
Now, it can be said that they have finally reached a milestone.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ゾアン.png"]

[ゾアン]
I wonder if this will calm down a bit.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ヴァレリー.png"]

[ヴァレリー]
I do hope it turns out that way...[l][er]
Well, it's true what that person said.[l][er]
We did give the Augen und Ohr agent a tough job.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ゾアン.png"]

[ゾアン]
Devie-san and Noch-san must be angry too...[pcm]

[人物消去]

[クイーン]
[voice file = "e01q__03.ogg"]
Those two probably won't be able to come back for a while due to[r]hospitalization.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ゾアン.png"]

[ゾアン]
No, it seems like he was sent back after just putting on a bandage for a sprain,[r]the hospital.[pcm]

[クイーン]
[voice file = "e01q__04.ogg"]
What's going on? Are they really human?[pcm]

[人物消去]

Murmuring their likes one after another...[l][er]
sighing together. As the night breaks, little by little, information about the[r]incident will be disclosed, and the world will become busy.[pcm]

The whereabouts of themselves may have settled down, but the[r]world will continue to be in turmoil from now on.[l][er]
That expectation crosses their minds, stealing away the small joys and leaving[r]them with a feeling of excitement.[pcm]

Nevertheless...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ゾアン.png"]

[ゾアン]
The other one might be getting tired of waiting.[l][er]
It's about time to come out.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ヴァレリー.png"]

[ヴァレリー]
Yes, let's have breakfast somewhere and then go back.[l][er]
We can report to Larca-san and the 'young lady' afterwards.[pcm]

[人物消去]

Queen leaned back against her seat without saying a word, turning her face away[r]from the men in the front seats who were nodding in agreement.[pcm]

The car carrying the three of them slowly starts moving.[pcm]

[会話シーン file = "【背景】ビル屋上(日の出).png"]

The morning light is shining through the gap in the building.[pcm]
