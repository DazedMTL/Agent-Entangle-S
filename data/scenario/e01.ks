In a corner of the rooftop of a tall building, under the[r]
dimly lit sky just before sunrise.[pcm]

[イベント絵表示 file = "【イベント】アナザー.bmp"]

In front of a girl with a slightly dark skin, long hair with[r]
a hint of emerald green... Her supple limbs reminiscent of a[r]
wild carnivorous beast... scattered before her are pieces of[r]
meat that have been cut up into pieces.[pcm]

The purple slime mixed with the bright red blood tells that[r]
the corpse is not just human.[pcm]

"...Otsu Akiharu, Vice Principal of Yamiya Academy's General[r]
Department.  More accurately, it was someone who had taken[r]
on the identity of Otsu Akiharu, the 'someone'."[pcm]

The mastermind behind the series of student disappearances[r]
that resulted in four victims had met their demise without[r]
ever basking in the sunlight.[pcm]

He, who has been artificially modified and is called a[r]
"demon," is an abnormal being. It is likely that this fact[r]
will never be made public. ...The girls who slaughtered him[r]
will hunt down every last one of them.[pcm]

The girl... Another, after releasing the unfolded blade of[r]
the S.G. Guillotine she held in her hand, reached out to the[r]
headset.[pcm]

The driver in the driver's seat, who answered the call from[r]

a big sigh, "Phew."[pcm]

Assistant in the passenger seat... Valerie Novak, who serves[r]
as the coordinator of the Temperance Unit, called out to the[r]
man in the rear seat through the mirror.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】払田先生.png"]

The man sitting in the rear seat without hiding his[r]
displeased expression, snorted. It seems that he reluctantly[r]
agreed, for now.[pcm]

The well-built middle-aged... no, elderly man, with deep[r]
wrinkles between his eyebrows, continues to glare at the[r]
back of Valerie and Zoaan's heads.[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】疑惑・ミステリー.ogg"]

Satomichi Haruta... Second year, regular course, Year Head[r]
at Hachimiya Academy.[pcm]

The hidden face is a member of the Information Investigation[r]
Department of Goldberg Pharmaceuticals Japan Branch.[r]
However, this title was added a few years ago. He was[r]
originally a pure teacher, but Goldberg headhunted him.[pcm]

Valerie and Zoaan used to be their superiors, but for them[r]
who had fled from Goldberg, he was now more of an enemy than[r]
anything else.[pcm]

[払田]
"...For now, I'll express my gratitude for this matter. It[r]
was a case that was beyond our control. Although it was[r]
resolved amidst chaos, I truly feel relieved that it was[r]
handled."[pcm]

Valerie shrugged her shoulders at the tone of whether it was[r]
genuine or sarcastic.[pcm]

"Speaking of Director Gene's private plan, using human[r]
trafficking... Isn't it too sloppy? They even used the demon[r]
that they had kept as their pet."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】払田先生.png"]

[払田]
"Tell it directly to the person themselves... Although it's[r]
hopeless if we don't know where that Gene went."[pcm]

[人物消去]

The disappearance and subsequent human trafficking incident[r]
were planned by a man named Gene, who serves as a section[r]
chief at Goldberg Pharmaceuticals. The perpetrators, such as[r]
Otsu and Sakagawa, were essentially Gene's underlings...[r]
disposable pawns.[pcm]

However, they were entrusted with access rights to the[r]
network of the security company under Goldberg's control,[r]
which manages much of the surveillance system in Hachimiya[r]
City. They skillfully viewed and tampered with real-time[r]
footage and video recordings.[pcm]

The success of kidnapping four female students without[r]
leaving any traces behind.[pcm]

Satomichi Haruta, who originally belonged to a department[r]
that controls and manages such situations, was in a[r]
situation where he had no choice but to remain silent in the[r]
face of the strong authority of Gene, who is the section[r]
chief attached to the US headquarters. For him, who is a[r]
teacher by profession, this is nothing but humiliation.[pcm]

One by one, as the students continued to disappear, a[r]
turning point arrived. ... In early August, just about a[r]
month and a half ago, Section Chief Gene, who had visited[r]
Hachimiya City, suddenly vanished.[pcm]

The trigger was the "accident" at the Goldberg-affiliated[r]
facility... With all communication lost and the specific[r]
"interference" from the US headquarters gone, Haruta made a[r]
gamble.[pcm]

"They reported the crimes being committed within the school[r]
to the Temperance Unit, with whom they had been in conflict,[r]
including the 'accident'."[pcm]

"Of course, it was a serious act of betrayal towards the[r]
company... but Haruta's regret for not being able to protect[r]
the students was immense. He was originally a diligent and[r]
sincere teacher. There was no falsehood in his genuine[r]
desire to protect the students and the school."[pcm]

The Temperance Unit planned the surveillance within the[r]
school based on the provided information, and the arrow of[r]
choice as their agent was...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】払田先生.png"]

[払田]
"...I never expected it would be Satomi-kun who came. It's a[r]
pity for that resilient girl. I didn't want to involve Emma-[r]
kun in such a terrible incident either."[pcm]

[人物消去]

The truth is, more than half of Haruta's dissatisfaction[r]
stemmed from that. Beyond the situation of relying on[r]
enemies and traitors, he was angry about the fact that they[r]
sent Satomi, who was an impressive student to Haruta, even[r]
if it wasn't intentional.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ヴァレリー.png"]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ヴァレリー.png"]

"Excuse me. ... Anyway, can we consider the debts settled as[r]
promised? Especially regarding Queen and Another..."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】払田先生.png"]

[払田]
"I understand. ...I'll put in a good word with Rosie DM.[r]
...I was worried about you guys too."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ヴァレリー.png"]

[ヴァレリー]
"I see. Well, please tell Satomi and Emma that I'm doing[r]
well too."[pcm]

[人物消去]

"Understanding Valerie's cold words, Haruta answered shortly[r]
and opened the rear door."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ゾアン.png"]

[ゾアン]
"Shall I see you off...?"[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】払田先生.png"]

[払田]
"I won't tolerate being picked up in the enemy's car."[pcm]

[人物消去]

Satomi Haruta, who spat out his words and stood up from his[r]
seat... As he stepped outside the car, he noticed a girl[r]
standing with her back towards him near the rear wheel.[pcm]

"In the designated summer knit of the Hachimiya Academy[r]
girls' uniform, there was Ide Tatsu, with long braided hair[r]
and glasses, truly fitting the description of a 'student who[r]
doesn't stand out'..."[pcm]

"Haruta snorted and approached the student with a stern[r]
expression."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】払田先生.png"]

[払田]
"…While you were there, it seems that Emma-kun was attacked[r]
by 'that'. The Queen of the modified humans would be[r]
astonished to hear about it."[pcm]

[人物消去]

The girl... Queen, despite the obvious contempt, doesn't[r]
even furrow her brow as if she's unfazed. However, Haruta,[r]
even though he's dealing with a student, his expression is[r]
filled with even more anger.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】払田先生.png"]

[払田]
"If it weren't for you, this school would have been[r]
peaceful. I wouldn't have had to resort to acting like a[r]
spy! ...Just graduate already and disappear from this town,[r]
you jinx!!"[pcm]

[人物消去]

Haruta spat out his words and walked away, anger evident in[r]
his shoulders.[pcm]

Queen is silently watching, expressionless.[pcm]

"What is that!? This is the worst...!!"[pcm]

The girl who got into the back seat in place of Haruta,[r]
Queen, had a complete change in expression from her composed[r]
demeanor just a moment ago, her face contorted in anger. It[r]
could be said that it was appropriate for her age, but she[r]
also had a somewhat childish demeanor.[pcm]

"Well, well, well..."[pcm]

Valerie sighed softly, trying to calm down the enraged[r]
Queen. With this, it seemed like things had settled down a[r]
bit.[pcm]

It can be said that from around June, it was a tumultuous[r]
period for them. The environment changed, their lives[r]
changed, and even the faction they belonged to changed. Now,[r]
it can be said that they have finally reached a milestone.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ゾアン.png"]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ヴァレリー.png"]

"I do hope it turns out that way... Well, it's true what[r]

"What's going on? Are they really human?"[pcm]

[人物消去]

"Murmuring their likes one after another... sighing[r]
together. As the night breaks, little by little, information[r]
about the incident will be disclosed, and the world will[r]
become busy."[pcm]

The whereabouts of themselves may have settled down, but the[r]
world will continue to be in turmoil from now on. That[r]
expectation crosses their minds, stealing away the small[r]
joys and leaving them with a feeling of excitement.[pcm]

Nevertheless...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ゾアン.png"]

[ゾアン]
"The other one might be getting tired of waiting. It's about[r]
time to come out."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ヴァレリー.png"]

[ヴァレリー]
"Yes, let's have breakfast somewhere and then go back. We[r]
can report to Larca-san and the 'young lady' afterwards."[pcm]

[人物消去]

Queen leaned back against her seat without saying a word,[r]
turning her face away from the men in the front seats who[r]
were nodding in agreement.[pcm]

The car carrying the three of them slowly starts moving.[pcm]
