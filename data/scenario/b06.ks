It's raining.[pcm]

The coastal area of Yamiya City, the warehouse district.[r]
This area is filled with numerous large warehouses from an[r]
old era that couldn't fully adapt to logistics.[pcm]

Among them... Several men had gathered in a warehouse owned[r]
by an overseas pharmaceutical company that had its office in[r]
Yamiya City, despite it being late at night.[pcm]

All of them were wearing inconspicuous work clothes... In[r]
the dark and empty warehouse, they were preparing to move[r]
out large packages that could fit in a refrigerator.[pcm]

The reinforced FRP exterior with an attached frame, equipped[r]
with a battery-powered unit... Even an amateur can sense[r]
that the "contents" are far from ordinary. It has an[r]
appearance reminiscent of a coffin.[pcm]

It is sealed tightly and there are a total of four of them.[r]
... If there were lifts or cranes, they could be moved out[r]
immediately.[pcm]

There was another "coffin" that had not yet been sealed,[r]
placed in a corner of the warehouse. Its lid was still open,[r]
and the interior, reminiscent of a water tank, was empty.[pcm]

Next to the "coffin," there are two men who are preparing[r]
for removal. One of them is standing with a bucket in his[r]
hand, and the other is crouching down, playing with[r]
something rolling at his feet.[pcm]

The bucket is filled with dirty water and emits a terrible[r]
smell. Vomit, urine, feces, sweat... various types of bodily[r]
waste.[pcm]

[坂川]
"There's nothing left to come out. You can flush it away."[pcm]

[男A]
"Understood."[pcm]

The man crouching down... Upon being told by Sakagawa, the[r]
man went outside the warehouse with a bucket and went to[r]
dispose of the contents in the sea.[pcm]

Sakagawa, on the other hand, placed the glass enema device[r]
he was holding on the ground and wiped the sweat off his[r]
forehead with a sigh.[pcm]

In front of him, there was a girl lying on the ground.[pcm]

The girl, blindfolded and bound with her hands behind her[r]
back, is convulsing and dripping a large amount of[r]
transparent liquid from her groin.[pcm]

She, who was thoroughly stimulated to excrete with an enema,[r]
emptied the contents of her intestines into the bucket from[r]
earlier, and on top of that, her mouth was forced open and[r]
she was made to vomit over and over again. She is trembling[r]
with rough breathing.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "b06e__01.ogg"]
"Ah...guh...ah..."[pcm]

The only fortunate thing was that her... Satomi Emma's[r]
consciousness had already been lost a long time ago.[pcm]

Her sanity, thoroughly destroyed by being gang-raped by men,[r]
had already been completely lost hours ago.[pcm]

Satomi Emma, who is currently lying in front of Sakagawa,[r]
can be more accurately described as someone who "used to be"[r]
rather than someone who is currently experiencing suffering[r]
and has self-awareness.[pcm]

[坂川]
"Hehe... You've become quite obedient, Emma-chan."[pcm]

Sakagawa, with a cruel smile on his face, seemed genuinely[r]
delighted.[pcm]

The last prey that was not originally part of the plan...[r]
There was a slight mistake at the very end and the hiding[r]
place was exposed to the police, but it's a trivial matter.[r]
In any case, they will disappear from Hachimiya tonight. The[r]
preparations for that are already complete.[pcm]

[坂川]
"Even if you were to sleep inside this, it would be[r]
troublesome if you were to leak along the way. Did the enema[r]
feel good? You were releasing a lot, huh."[pcm]

Sakagawa strokes Emma's head as she lies there. She was a[r]
foolish girl, but now she's cute... Sakagawa truly thought[r]
so.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "b06e__02.ogg"]
"Ugh...guh..."[pcm]

[効果音 file = "【SE】ぬちゅ１.ogg"]

Satomi Emma trembles and convulses, vomiting a small amount[r]
of stomach acid. Her weak appearance reminds Sakagawa of the[r]
heat deep in Emma's throat, filling his heart.[pcm]

[坂川]
"Hehe, it's a good job... being able to completely destroy a[r]
girl like you... it's the best..."[pcm]

"Revealing the truth behind Rui's actions, the woman who had[r]
never shown such rage before, had become a complete wreck[r]
half a day later... Sakagawa was overwhelmed by this sudden[r]
and thrilling turn of events."[pcm]

The beautifully toned body, once firm and tight from[r]
swimming, is now completely relaxed and weakened, convulsing[r]
as its contents are emptied from the stomach... The sense of[r]
accomplishment, knowing that I have achieved this, is[r]
nurturing a pleasure within Sakagawa that is close to[r]
ecstasy.[pcm]

[男A]
"You're such a cruel teacher, aren't you?"[pcm]

The man who disposed of the filth in the bucket returned and[r]
said in a disgusted manner. Sakagawa, who had been in a[r]
trance, came back to his senses and confirmed the men[r]
working in the center of the warehouse.[pcm]

[坂川]
"Actually, you know, I wanted to make Satomi-sensei the same[r]
as this girl. Wouldn't it be dramatic if I packaged them[r]
together in the same box as sisters?"[pcm]

[男A]
"Idiot, what about life support? This is for one person."[pcm]

"As the man pounded on the edge of the coffin, he said,[r]
'That's right,' and Sakagawa laughed. However, Sakagawa was[r]
quite serious. He truly believed that it would be touching[r]
for the sisters to be wrapped together harmoniously."[pcm]

[男A]
"That teacher seemed to be an agent from a major[r]
investigation company... There's no way they'll come after[r]
us, right?"[pcm]

[坂川]
"Well then... I wonder. That would be interesting in its own[r]
way. If we were to meet again, I wonder what would become of[r]
her by then..."[pcm]

From Emma's rolling waist to her buttocks, Sakagawa's hand[r]
creeps, and he smiles. Whether it's a human specimen,[r]
disassembled into only organs, a guinea pig for drug[r]
experiments, or an even more cruel fate...[pcm]

The men here, including Sakagawa, are not aware of what the[r]
purpose of the "living girls" is, but it is easy to predict[r]
that there is an inevitable and unfavorable outcome waiting[r]
for them.[pcm]

"I wonder what kind of expression that teacher will have[r]
when they meet the sister who has become nothing but a piece[r]
of flesh... For Sakagawa, it is quite an intriguing[r]
development. I even hope that it turns out that way."[pcm]

[坂川]
"Hehe... Isn't it nice, Emma-chan? Satomi-sensei seems like[r]
a gentle older sister..."[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "b06e__03.ogg"]
"Oh...sleep..."[pcm]

Sakagawa's voice could be heard, and Emma's moan seemed to[r]
react slightly to the word "sister." Sakagawa placed his[r]
hand on his mouth, as if his heart was about to overflow.[pcm]

[坂川]
"I'm glad I persisted, it's the best outcome."[pcm]

[男A]
"I can't keep up, seriously..."[pcm]

The man sighed at Sakagawa, who didn't even bother to hide[r]
his abnormality that went beyond simply being a criminal...[r]
Of course, it was well known that he was that kind of man.[pcm]

When he directed his gaze towards the central area of the[r]
warehouse where the preparations for removal were taking[r]
place, sensing that it was about time, Sakagawa picked up[r]
the enema device he had placed and threw it into the bucket.[pcm]

[男A]
"It's about time to contact Otsu-san... Let's also 'package'[r]
that person."[pcm]

[坂川]
"Ah... I see. Let's do that. It's a bit regrettable."[pcm]

"Hmm, stretching his back, Sakagawa took out a vial and[r]
syringe from the chest pocket of his work clothes."[pcm]

The contents of the vial are equivalent to the drugs that[r]
Emma was forced to inhale before the orgy... Through[r]
intravenous injection, it induces a state of unconsciousness[r]
far beyond mere aphrodisiac effects.[pcm]

[坂川]
"Goodbye, Emma-chan. It was fun."[pcm]

Sakagawa announces while filling the syringe with drugs.[pcm]

The thin needle of the syringe is drawn into Emma's[r]
trembling arm... The transparent medication enters her body,[r]
dissolves, and violates her brain.[pcm]

[フラッシュ type = "赤"]


[エマ]
[voice file = "b06e__04.ogg"]
"...uh, ah..."[pcm]

Emma groans.[pcm]

The broken mind melts into darkness, becoming muddy.[pcm]
