Twilight.[pcm]


The corner where the old townscape remains, rather than being delayed in[r]redevelopment, is located outside the central area of Yamiya.[pcm]


The vast vacant land has turned into a terrible overgrown grass about 2 meters[r]tall, Beyond that, there is a solitary concrete building left standing.[pcm]


The location is not just lonely, but rather eerie.[l][er]
However, Emma and her friend, Rui Asaka, had a different purpose than that[r]building.[pcm]


Facing towards the vacant lot, there were old single-story[r]houses lined up with thin-looking exterior walls...[l][er]
To Emma and her friends, these worn-out row houses seemed even more outdated[r]than they were interesting, and they had come to see them as a sightseeing[r]attraction.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM2e__01.ogg"]
Is it okay to see it from the back?[pcm]


[人物 file = "【立ち絵】瑠衣(制服).png"]

[瑠衣]
Hmm, it feels rude to stare at it from the front...[pcm]


[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_普通.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM2e__02.ogg"]
Well... I guess so. It looks like someone lives there.[pcm]


[人物消去]

Emma couldn't help but laugh a little at Rui, who was sneakily taking photos[r]with her smartphone while saying, It feels creepy as they looked at the back of[r]the old row houses through the overgrown grass.[pcm]


Emma is generally a well-behaved and serious girl, but[r]occasionally doing things like this is impressive for her.[l][er]
She tries her best to act serious, but it's interesting to know that she has a[r]somewhat vulgar side to her true nature.[pcm]


[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_楽.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM2e__03.ogg"]
It's surprising that such old houses are still remaining in the middle of[r]Yamiya.[pcm]


[人物 file = "【立ち絵】瑠衣(制服).png"]

[瑠衣]
Hey, I wonder how much the rent is...[pcm]


[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_普通.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM2e__04.ogg"]
Do you want to live here?[pcm]


[人物 file = "【立ち絵】瑠衣(制服).png"]

[瑠衣]
Hmm, I don't want to live here, but if it's cheap, it might be worth[r]considering...[pcm]


[人物消去]

In Rui's words and actions, which subtly reveal her desire to live alone as soon[r]as she leaves home, Emma also nods and says, 'Yeah, I feel the same...[pcm]

'[pcm]Both Emma and Rui had never had a deep conversation or made[r]any arrangements.[l][er]
However, they both shared the feeling of being uncomfortable at home.[pcm]


[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_楽.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM2e__05.ogg"]
...... If we share it together, maybe it would work, like while working part-[r]time.[pcm]


[人物 file = "【立ち絵】瑠衣(制服).png"]

[瑠衣]
Oh, that's good... It's a good idea, Emma is hardworking.[pcm]


[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_怒.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM2e__06.ogg"]
Properly contribute half, okay!?[pcm]


[人物消去]

Both of them couldn't help but raise their voices and laugh together.[pcm]


I wish this time where I can stay away from home, even for a minute or a second,[r]would continue.[pcm]


Both of them, day after day, earnestly and sincerely wished for it.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

[陽子]
... Seriously, no contact at all?[pcm]


That girl who suddenly says something like that...[l][er]
Yoko Natsuno doesn't have an expression that suggests she doubts me as much as[r]her tone implies.[pcm]


[人物消去]

This child always does that. Intentionally saying things in[r]a bad way.[l][er]
Maybe it's because they can't have a conversation without[r]first gauging the other person's reaction.[l][er]
It's troublesome, but once you get used to it, well, you won't feel unpleasant.[pcm]


During lunch break, after finishing the bento we bought at the school cafeteria,[r]we sat facing each other with nothing particular to do, and absentmindedly gazed[r]out the window.[pcm]


[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_不機嫌.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM2e__07.ogg"]
Even if you ask me all the time, it's troublesome.[pcm]


[人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

[陽子]
Well, that's true...[pcm]


[人物消去]

Yoko, who scratches her head and avoids eye contact with a[r]guilty expression, doesn't look happy.[l][er]
She's not the type to smile all the time, but she's been[r]like this for a while now.[l][er]
Well, I can't really say anything about other people either.[pcm]


Yoko, who was in the swimming club with me and Rui in middle[r]school, has been busy with various things since entering[r]high school and has distanced herself from swimming.[l][er]
However, she also worried about Rui's whereabouts.[pcm]


Our close relationship... it's natural for people to talk[r]about Rui's disappearance within the school.[l][er]
In a negative way.[pcm]


There is probably not a single student who considers the consecutive[r]disappearances of female students in the swimming club since last year's third[r]term as mere coincidence.[pcm]


The cause, of course, is completely unknown, as well as the[r]whereabouts after the disappearance...[l][er]
There are even people who speculate that they were abducted overseas just for[r]fun.[pcm]


[人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

[陽子]
It seems like there have been quite a few members quitting, but what are you[r]going to do?[pcm]


[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_普通.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM2e__08.ogg"]
What are you going to do... I'm not going to do anything though.[pcm]


[人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

[陽子]
You know...[pcm]


[人物消去]

I don't know how many times we've had this exchange since[r]summer vacation ended...[l][er]
It's bad of me to be unresponsive and indifferent, but I also think there's an[r]issue with Yoko always talking about the same thing.[pcm]


[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_普通.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM2e__09.ogg"]
There's no specific reason for me to quit like Yoko.[l][er]
... I feel bad, even though she's worried about me.[pcm]


[人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

When I deliberately said 'Thank you' in a casual manner,[r]Yoko turned her head with a 'hmph'.[l][er]
Her well-tanned skin was slightly flushed.[pcm]


[人物消去]

I understand. She may have a habit of picking on me, but[r]this girl is a worrier and always cares about me in one way[r]or another.[l][er]
Everyone knows that, which is why she's entrusted with class[r]committee duties.[l][er]
She dislikes it herself though.[pcm]


Yes, I can't quit. I can't quit right here and now.[pcm]


I've gradually come to understand Mr.[l][er]
Sakagawa's true nature. I can't believe that person has nothing to do with Rui's[r]disappearance.[pcm]


For Rui's sake, and for my own sake...[l][er]
There's no way I can back down now.[pcm]


[人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

[陽子]
I hope they resolve it quickly.[pcm]


[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_哀.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM2e__10.ogg"]
That's right.[pcm]


[人物消去]

That's really true. I genuinely feel the same way.[pcm]


That's why I have to go deeper...[l][er]
I have to go deeper.[pcm]


To expose everything as soon as possible.[l][er]
To regain Rui... my irreplaceable friend.[pcm]
