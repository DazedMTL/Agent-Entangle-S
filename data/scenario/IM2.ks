Twilight.[pcm]

The corner where the old townscape remains, rather than[r]
being delayed in redevelopment, is located outside the[r]
central area of Yamiya.[pcm]

The vast vacant land has turned into a terrible overgrown[r]
grass about 2 meters tall, Beyond that, there is a solitary[r]
concrete building left standing.[pcm]

The location is not just lonely, but rather eerie. However,[r]
Emma and her friend, Rui Asaka, had a different purpose than[r]
that building.[pcm]

"Facing towards the vacant lot, there were old single-story[r]
houses lined up with thin-looking exterior walls... To Emma[r]
and her friends, these worn-out row houses seemed even more[r]
outdated than they were interesting, and they had come to[r]
see them as a sightseeing attraction."[pcm]

"Is it okay to see it from the back?"[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】瑠衣(制服).png"]

[瑠衣]
"Hmm, it feels rude to stare at it from the front..."[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM2e__02.ogg"]
"Well... I guess so. It looks like someone lives there."[pcm]

[人物消去]

Emma couldn't help but laugh a little at Rui, who was[r]
sneakily taking photos with her smartphone while saying, "It[r]
feels creepy" as they looked at the back of the old row[r]
houses through the overgrown grass.[pcm]

Emma is generally a well-behaved and serious girl, but[r]
occasionally doing things like this is impressive for her.[r]
She tries her best to act serious, but it's interesting to[r]
know that she has a somewhat vulgar side to her true nature.[pcm]

"It's surprising that such old houses are still remaining in[r]
the middle of Yamiya."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】瑠衣(制服).png"]

[瑠衣]
"Hey, I wonder how much the rent is..."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_普通.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM2e__04.ogg"]
"Do you want to live here?"[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】瑠衣(制服).png"]

[瑠衣]
"Hmm, I don't want to live here, but if it's cheap, it might[r]
be worth considering..."[pcm]

[人物消去]

"In Rui's words and actions, which subtly reveal her desire[r]
to live alone as soon as she leaves home, Emma also nods and[r]
says, 'Yeah, I feel the same...'"[pcm]

Both Emma and Rui had never had a deep conversation or made[r]
any arrangements. However, they both shared the feeling of[r]
being uncomfortable at home.[pcm]

"......If we share it together, maybe it would work, like[r]
while working part-time."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】瑠衣(制服).png"]

[瑠衣]
"Oh, that's good... It's a good idea, Emma is hardworking."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_怒.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM2e__06.ogg"]
"Properly contribute half, okay!?"[pcm]

[人物消去]

Both of them couldn't help but raise their voices and laugh[r]
together.[pcm]

I wish this time where I can stay away from home, even for a[r]
minute or a second, would continue.[pcm]

Both of them, day after day, earnestly and sincerely wished[r]
for it.[pcm]

"...Seriously, no contact at all?"[pcm]

"That girl who suddenly says something like that... Yoko[r]
Natsuno doesn't have an expression that suggests she doubts[r]
me as much as her tone implies."[pcm]

[人物消去]

This child always does that. Intentionally saying things "in[r]
a bad way". Maybe it's because they can't have a[r]
conversation without first gauging the other person's[r]
reaction. It's troublesome, but once you get used to it,[r]
well, you won't feel unpleasant.[pcm]

"During lunch break, after finishing the bento we bought at[r]
the school cafeteria, we sat facing each other with nothing[r]
particular to do, and absentmindedly gazed out the window."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_不機嫌.png"]

[voice file = "IM2e__07.ogg"]
"Even if you ask me all the time, it's troublesome."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

[陽子]
"Well, that's true..."[pcm]

[人物消去]

Yoko, who scratches her head and avoids eye contact with a[r]
guilty expression, doesn't look happy. She's not the type to[r]
smile all the time, but she's been like this for a while[r]
now. Well, I can't really say anything about other people[r]
either.[pcm]

Yoko, who was in the swimming club with me and Rui in middle[r]
school, has been busy with various things since entering[r]
high school and has distanced herself from swimming.[r]
However, she also worried about Rui's whereabouts.[pcm]

Our close relationship... it's natural for people to talk[r]
about Rui's disappearance within the school. In a negative[r]
way.[pcm]

There is probably not a single student who considers the[r]
consecutive disappearances of female students in the[r]
swimming club since last year's third term as mere[r]
coincidence.[pcm]

The cause, of course, is completely unknown, as well as the[r]
whereabouts after the disappearance... There are even people[r]
who speculate that they were abducted overseas just for fun.[pcm]

"It seems like there have been quite a few members quitting,[r]
but what are you going to do?"[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_普通.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM2e__08.ogg"]
"What are you going to do... I'm not going to do anything[r]
though."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

[陽子]
"You know..."[pcm]

[人物消去]

"I don't know how many times we've had this exchange since[r]
summer vacation ended... It's bad of me to be unresponsive[r]
and indifferent, but I also think there's an issue with Yoko[r]
always talking about the same thing."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_普通.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM2e__09.ogg"]
"There's no specific reason for me to quit like Yoko. ...I[r]
feel bad, even though she's worried about me."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

"When I deliberately said 'Thank you' in a casual manner,[r]
Yoko turned her head with a 'hmph'. Her well-tanned skin was[r]
slightly flushed."[pcm]

[人物消去]

I understand. She may have a habit of picking on me, but[r]
this girl is a worrier and always cares about me in one way[r]
or another. Everyone knows that, which is why she's[r]
entrusted with class committee duties. She dislikes it[r]
herself though.[pcm]

"Yes, I can't quit. I can't quit right here and now."[pcm]

"I've gradually come to understand Mr. Sakagawa's true[r]
nature. I can't believe that person has nothing to do with[r]
Rui's disappearance."[pcm]

For Rui's sake, and for my own sake... There's no way I can[r]
back down now.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】陽子.png"]

[陽子]
"I hope they resolve it quickly."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_哀.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "IM2e__10.ogg"]
"That's right."[pcm]

[人物消去]

"That's really true. I genuinely feel the same way."[pcm]

That's why I have to go deeper... I have to go deeper.[pcm]

To expose everything as soon as possible. To regain Rui...[r]
my irreplaceable friend.[pcm]
