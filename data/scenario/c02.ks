[男A]
Sorry, Sensei.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__01.ogg"]
Ugh, aahhh...[pcm]

Satomi, pushed down onto the dirty floor by a man, was about[r]to be assaulted.[l][er]
At that moment... the men heard footsteps approaching from outside.[pcm]

In the midst of the chaotic frenzy, the men's vigilance was[r]always strong.[l][er]
Normally, this time of day would be deserted in the secluded[r]corner of the park...[l][er]
but involuntarily, the tension heightened.[pcm]

The footsteps were light and fast, but filled with urgency.[l][er]
It was immediately clear that it wasn't a runner who liked to run on the[r]outskirts of the park.[pcm]

Furthermore, from behind those fast footsteps, several...[pcm]

[男A]
Hey[pcm][男D]
Aah...[pcm]

One of the urged men skillfully dragged Satomi's body and[r]pulled her into a private room.[l][er]
Meanwhile, the footsteps continued straight towards the public restroom, getting[r]closer and closer...[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】悲壮な決意.ogg"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__01.ogg"]
Big sister!![pcm]

The men were truly taken aback by the appearance of a high school girl who came[r]with a voice that was almost a scream.[pcm]

Satomi Emma... chosen by Sakagawa as the final target, a[r]member of the swimming club.[l][er]
There's no way I wouldn't know.[l][er]
All the men here have been summoned by Sakagawa and even gang-raped this girl.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__02.ogg"]
Where is my sister...!!?[pcm]

Satomi, who had been thrown into a private room, was not[r]visible from Emma's desperate and intense expression.[l][er]
However, it was immediately apparent from the foul odor filling the restroom[r]what was taking place.[pcm]

[男C]
Hey, hey Emma-chan... what's wrong?[l][er]
Why are you alone?[pcm]

[男D]
It's dangerous to be out this late at night...[l][er]
or maybe you want to have some fun with us again?[pcm]

At the moment when the man reached out his hand towards[r]Emma,[pcm][音楽ストップ]

[男D]
HabyupcmFrom behind Emma, there was a loud explosion and a flash...[pcm]

The man, squeezing out a harsh sound that couldn't even be called a voice from[r]his throat, was slammed onto the tiled floor of the restroom in a twisted[r]position, rotating two and a half times in mid-air...[pcm]

Silence dominates the public restroom...[l][er]
Even Emma's eyes widen. The men's expressions freeze, unable to comprehend the[r]momentary event that just occurred before their eyes, they stare wide-eyed.[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】走る.ogg"]

[デヴィ]
Hey, stop right there! Don't move![pcm]

Two sets of footsteps approaching late...[l][er]
revealed by the light leaking from the public restroom, their figures were a[r]pair of men, one wide and short, and the other narrow and tall.[pcm]

The men, Devi and Nocho, who are communication officers of the Temperance Unit,[r]are holding what appears to be shotgun- like weapons in their hands.[pcm]

[ノッホ]
Emma-chan, you're in too much of a hurry...[l][er]
Ah, it's tight...[pcm]

[デヴィ]
Haah, haah, I'm getting skinny...[pcm]

Devi and Nocho were panting heavily, exhausted...[l][er]
After all, they had been chasing Emma at full speed from the[r]parking lot of the park.[l][er]
The athletic legs of the youthful sports club member had thoroughly worn them[r]out.[pcm]

[男B]
You guys...[pcm]

[ノッホ]
Haah, haah... Don't move, you punks.[l][er]
It's rubber bullets, but they're not for play.[l][er]
If you don't want to end up like that guy, don't resist unnecessarily.[pcm]

Nocho points with his chin at one of the men who was blown[r]away earlier.[l][er]
... On the floor of the restroom, he is trembling and convulsing while bleeding[r]from his mouth.[pcm]

The high-impact material used to suppress rioters...[l][er]
It hit the man's lower jaw, shattering his jawbone and teeth into pieces.[pcm]

[デヴィ]
Emma-chan, just step back a little.[pcm]

Emma, who is also confused like the men, is temporarily moved outside the[r]restroom, and Devi and Nocho step forward while panting heavily.[pcm]

[ノッホ]
I have 4 shots left. My partner also has 4 shots left...[l][er]
I think it's enough to take care of all of you like that guy[r]over there...[l][er]
What are we going to do?[pcm]

[デヴィ]
Phew... Just to explain, it's a choice between getting[r]caught and experiencing pain, or getting caught without[r]experiencing pain.[l][er]
I'd prefer to take a little break if possible...[pcm]

Intrusion, and two armed men...[l][er]
Even the men themselves are bewildered by the sudden situation, looking at each[r]other's faces in confusion.[pcm]

But... there is no need to think.[l][er]
Their choice has already been determined.[pcm]

The third option... eliminate the intruders and escape from[r]here.[l][er]
That's all. There is absolutely no intention of being caught quietly.[pcm]

Originally, these men are accustomed to violence, no, they[r]specialize in violence.[l][er]
Even if the opponent is armed, there are only two of them.[l][er]
Above all, they have a hostage to use as a shield.[pcm]

[男A]
The ones who will suffer... are you guys...[pcm]

[ノッホ]
Ahh...[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】暴力.ogg"]

The moment when one of the men reached out to Satomi, who[r]had just been thrown into the restroom...[l][er]
The gun held by the intruder fired again.[pcm]

[男A]
Gyah[pcm][男F]
Hebuuu[pcm]The flash, the sound of impact, screams...[l][er]
It repeated five times, and in an instant, the inside of the restroom became[r]quiet.[pcm]

The men had made a mistake in their judgment of the situation.[pcm]

Devi and Nocho were more accustomed to violence than them,[r]and from the beginning, they intended to shoot and[r]incapacitate everyone.[l][er]
... The moment they stepped into the restroom, it was as if their defeat had[r]already been determined.[pcm]

[音楽フェードアウト time = "1000"]

Finally, the restroom became quiet...[l][er]
Devi and Nocho, who were waiting behind, urged Emma.[l][er]
Emma... somewhat hesitant due to the actions of the men she accompanied, stepped[r]into the restroom once again.[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】リグレット.ogg"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__03.ogg"]
Big sister... big sister...!![pcm]

Stepping over the men who were collapsed, bleeding, and trembling in fear, she[r]immediately noticed the presence of a private room.[pcm]

There, lying in a pitiful state, was the figure of Satomi.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__04.ogg"]
Big sister...[pcm]

Satomi, covered in sticky slime, emitting a terrible odor, and wearing a vacant[r]expression, Emma desperately lifts her sister up and sits her on the toilet seat[r]for the time being.[pcm]

Satomi's condition, which even an amateur could recognize as dangerous, made it[r]impossible for Emma to hold back her tears.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__05.ogg"]
Pull yourself together... Big sister...[l][er]
Big sister...[pcm]

Emma was somewhat informed about the plan of Satomi and Detective Natsuno[r]through Devi and Nocho on the way to the park.[pcm]

The primary objective of the plan is to ensure the safety of Emma and her uncle[r]and aunt, which is why Satomi willingly took on the extremely dangerous role as[r]a decoy.[pcm]

Satomi decided on this plan knowing that Emma was in a dangerous state...[pcm]

In order to prevent this from happening, I desperately tried[r]to act cold and keep my distance.[l][er]
I made up my mind to behave like a stranger because I didn't want to get[r]involved.[pcm]

Emma's head was already a mess, filled with misery, frustration, but above all,[r]worry and pride for her sister.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__02.ogg"]
Ugh... Ahh...[pcm]

Emma regains her composure at Satomi's groans.[l][er]
When she looks, she sees Satomi's eyes slightly open, staring intently at Emma's[r]face.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__06.ogg"]
Big sister...[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__03.ogg"]
Why are you here...?[pcm]

In a voice that seemed to fade away, she asked...[l][er]
or rather, it was almost like murmuring.[l][er]
But instead of answering, Emma tightly held Satomi's hand.[pcm]

[デヴィ]
Was it worth running with the determination to die?[pcm]

[ノッホ]
Exactly.[pcm]

The men who had fallen were tied up with their hands behind[r]their backs, as Devi and Nocho smirked and laughed together.[l][er]
It was a simple makeshift method of tying their thumbs together with a zip tie,[r]but it was deemed sufficient for the unconscious men.[pcm]

[デヴィ]
As for the retrieval of these guys...[l][er]
what should we do? Should we ask Zoaan to bring a car, or should we ask that[r]detective over there...[pcm]

[音楽ストップ]

[？？？]
No, we'll dismantle them here.[pcm]

The sudden voice that intruded made Devi, Nocho, and Emma all flinch and[r]tremble.[pcm]

Devi and Nocho looked up... There was a man standing at the entrance of the[r]restroom.[pcm]

The middle-aged man, slightly overweight in a suit.[l][er]
... His face filled with hatred and anger, his eyes burning with intensity.[pcm]

Otsu Akiharu, Vice Principal of Yamiya Academy.[l][er]
He is considered the mastermind behind the disappearance incident...[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】狂気の芽生え"]

[大津]
...... The plan that I had carefully crafted...[l][er]
If this had succeeded, I would have been welcomed by[r]Goldberg...[l][er]
But now...[pcm]
[pcm]

Trembling and shaking, Otsu's body...[l][er]
Devi and Nocho raise their shotguns again, sensing something unusual.[pcm]

However, Otsu seemed completely unaffected by the two's[r]behavior.[l][er]
Instead, anger welled up even deeper in his expression...[l][er]
Purple mucus sprayed and dripped from his forehead, cheeks, and neck.[pcm]

[大津]
I should have twisted and killed all of you from the[r]beginning...[l][er]
The police! The teachers! The stupid pawns![l][er]
The Queen, everything, everything, everything, eeeeeeehhhhhhhh!![pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】大津の正体.ogg"]

Otsu's body undergoes a transformation as he spits out[r]sticky mucus that clings to the back of his throat.[l][er]
The purple mucus assimilates with his body, tearing apart his suit from the[r]inside and growing into a gigantic form...[pcm]

[デヴィ]
Hey hey hey, this is bad, no way...[pcm]

[ノッホ]
No mistake, it's magic.[pcm]

The words of Nocho were interrupted, and a vibration and impact pierced through[r]the public restroom.[pcm]

The next moment, Devi and Nocho's bodies were forcefully[r]slammed against the tiled wall of the restroom...[l][er]
Both of them collapsed together.[pcm]

Otsu was blown away by countless branches that sprouted from[r]him...[l][er]
They were indescribable, flesh-like tentacles.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__07.ogg"]
Huh... Wha, what...[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__04.ogg"]
Emma... Run... Please run...[pcm]

Emma, who had been witnessing the situation fragmentarily inside the private[r]room, was perplexed, while Satomi kept repeating incoherent words.[pcm]

Satomi's consciousness was hazy, but she instinctively[r]understood that the situation in front of her was not[r]ordinary.[l][er]
Even though she didn't know the reason why Emma was there, she knew that it was[r]not a good situation for her to be in.[pcm]

However, Emma starts to move...[l][er]
No, even if she could move, she couldn't leave Satomi[r]behind...[l][er]
In front of the entrance to the private room, Otsu, who had undergone a[r]transformation, stood in the way.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__08.ogg"]
Huh... What...?[pcm]

Emma can only be speechless at that sight.[pcm]

Otsu's body had grown about twice its size.[l][er]
A dark purple, robust body, a mass resembling a shell covering half of the head,[r]and numerous tentacles extending from the groin...[pcm]

The appearance, which can only be described as monstrous, was so unreal that it[r]completely robbed Emma of her thoughts in an instant.[pcm]

*Hシーン

[イベント絵表示 file = "【イベントCG】c02_01.bmp"]

[大津]
I'll turn you all into trash meat right here![pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__09.ogg"]
Hiiii, iiiii, yaaahhhh!?!?![pcm]

The tentacles rushed into the private room all at once, entwining around Emma[r]and Satomi's bodies, as dripping slime wetted their bodies.[pcm]

Emma, unable to help but sense it, realizes what they are[r]trying to do as they possess a terrifying pressure, mass,[r]and an unexpected dexterity.[l][er]
They begin to strip Emma of her clothes and simultaneously restrain her limbs.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__10.ogg"]
Stop it! Let go!![pcm]

[大津]
Shut up!! If Sakagawa hadn't been fixated on you, we wouldn't have ended up in[r]this troublesome situation...!![pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__05.ogg"]
Please... forgive me... Emma will...[l][er]
take care of everything... so...[pcm]

[大津]
I told you to shut up!![pcm]

Satomi's tentacles, which had entwined around Otsu, swelled[r]and tightened.[l][er]
They grew about one size larger and dug into her wrists and[r]legs.[l][er]
Satomi's eyes widened as she recoiled in shock.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__06.ogg"]
Ugh, ahhhhhh...!![pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__11.ogg"]
Big sister!! Stop it, this is...!![pcm]

[大津]
If it weren't for you all, we wouldn't be in this mess...!![pcm]

The tips of the tentacles are pressed against Emma and[r]Satomi's groins, accompanied by a sticky squelching sound.[l][er]
They intend to penetrate all four of their orifices simultaneously - their[r]vaginas and anuses.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__12.ogg"]
Huh...[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__07.ogg"]
Stop... Only Emma... If you're going to do it, do it to me...[pcm]

[大津]
Dig into my stomach and die!![pcm]

With screams, the tentacles were simultaneously thrust into[r]the sisters.[l][er]
And...[pcm]

[イベント絵表示 file = "【イベントCG】c02_02.bmp"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__08.ogg"]
Ughhh[pcm][サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__09.ogg"]
Yaaaaahhhhh, aaaaahhhhh!![pcm]

Emma's and Satomi's voices echoed, and their bodies were violently thrust[r]upwards.[pcm]

The thickness, length, and flexibility that cannot be[r]compared to a human penis...[l][er]
Expanding each of their holes to the limit, simultaneously filling and[r]penetrating them tightly to the very depths, conforming to their individual[r]shapes.[pcm]

Satomi and Emma have both been thoroughly tormented by men,[r]but the intensity of this penetration was something they[r]were experiencing for the first time.[l][er]
It was incredibly intense, and also...[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__13.ogg"]
Gururu... Ji... What... is this...!?[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__10.ogg"]
Hii, guu, oohh, hiiii☆☆[pcm]The intense, melting voices of the females, overflowing with[r]agony...[l][er]
It was as if their entire bodies were being forcefully[r]seized by pleasure, surging from their vaginas and anuses.[l][er]
In an instant, their faces flushed with a shocking pleasure.[pcm]

[大津]
Die in madness, you female pigs![pcm]

Ugh, ohh, guh, ohh!! ☆☆ Shuggo, ohh, ohh, ohh!!   ☆☆[pcm]

The rough piston begins, and the four flesh holes open wide,[r]making squelching sounds...[l][er]
Not only the tentacle's slime, but also a large amount of love juice is being[r]rapidly secreted.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__12.ogg"]
Guh, ahh, nooo, stop, j- don't, nuuuhhhh☆[pcm]Emma's voice, as well as the exhausted Satomi's, resounded[r]with pleasure.[l][er]
It was not something as simple as being stimulated in the weak parts of their[r]sensitive spots.[pcm]

The intense pleasure that feels like every nerve and brain[r]in their entire body is being directly violated through[r]their vagina and rectum...[l][er]
Even just the tentacles alone are abnormal enough, but this rapid stimulation is[r]incredibly surreal.[pcm]

The aphrodisiac... Satomi and Emma have already experienced[r]the effects firsthand.[l][er]
The same effects as that drug are being brought about by the slime secreted by[r]the tentacles.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__15.ogg"]
Higuu, yaaahh, daaahh, meeehhhh☆☆ This is...[l][er]

[voice file = "c02e__16.ogg"]
Oh... it's coming... hi, it's intense!![l][er]
☆☆ Ah, ah, ah, ahhhh!![pcm]
☆☆[pcm]Satomi and Emma, with vulgar expressions they have never[r]made before, gasp and writhe while desperately encouraging[r]each other.[l][er]
However, the tentacles, as if mocking their attempts to hold onto their sanity,[r]became more violent.[pcm]

The tentacles wriggle like whips, and the impact causes a loud snap inside their[r]holes, bursting open.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__14.ogg"]
Ugh, ahhhh!![pcm]

The sisters writhed in agony from the violent impact[r]directly applied to their bodies.[l][er]
They arched their bodies as much as possible, spewing saliva and love juices as[r]they thrashed about.[pcm]

[大津]
Such an insolent hole... I'll make it all messy...!![pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__15.ogg"]
Ahh, ahh, guh, hiiii!![pcm]

The whip-like strikes of the tentacles, hitting directly inside their vagina and[r]rectum, resonate intensely in their bodies, especially in their uterus, creating[r]a pleasure that is not just sweet, but overwhelmingly intense.[pcm]

The four holes that engulfed the tentacles are wet and sticky with foaming love[r]juices and intestinal fluids, telling the depth of their pleasure.[pcm]

And, that expression...[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__17.ogg"]
Haah, haah, haaah... Huh, uuhh...   ☆[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__16.ogg"]
Hiiii, hiiii... uhhhh, huuuhh...   ☆[pcm]

Despite being exposed to intense attacks, their faces were[r]soaked with a melting ecstasy.[l][er]
The sisters were both excited by the expressions of female pleasure they had[r]never seen before.[pcm]

And as if seeing through the confusion and corruption of the two, Otsu's attacks[r]continue.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__18.ogg"]
No, stop, there, ahhh, ahhh!! Please stop, deep inside my butt, ahhh, ahhh, it[r]feels so good, so good, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh!![pcm]

While being forcefully penetrated in the anus with a[r]squelching sound, and relentlessly thrusting into the depths[r]of the vagina...[l][er]
Normally, such an intense attack would induce nausea, but it rapidly corrodes[r]Emma's mind into an overwhelming pleasure.[pcm]

The aphrodisiac itself is the same as that drug, but the tentacle's attack sets[r]it apart in terms of the method of administration.[pcm]

The experience they had until now was inhalation through the nasal passage, but[r]this time, it is directly applied to the sensitive spot by the tentacles,[r]enhancing the sensitivity of the sensitive spot and rapidly being absorbed into[r]the bloodstream.[pcm]

[大津]
Hehe, little by little, I'll twist it deeper and deeper...[l][er]
In the end, I'll make you spit out the tentacle from your mouth, so be[r]prepared...!![pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__17.ogg"]
Ah, y-yes, ah, ah, it feels so good, s-so good!![pcm]

The tentacles violating her anus thrashed around, attempting to reach her colon,[r]causing Satomi to scream and shake her head violently from side to side.[pcm]

At the same time as the pain, an intoxicating pleasure...[l][er]
In her hazy consciousness, she realizes that Otsu is trying to fulfill his[r]declaration.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__18.ogg"]
Ah, gi-, gu-, ahhhh!![pcm]

Ah, ma-, don't, I can't, I'm going to die, I'm going to[r]believe it☆☆[pcm]The relentless assault of the tentacles, penetrating deep[r]into the rectum, thrusting into the uterus, occasionally[r]mixed with internal whipping...[l][er]
The tentacles are about to completely destroy the sisters.[pcm]

The thrashing tentacles, covered in secretions and the bodily fluids overflowing[r]from the sisters, are leaving sticky trails, and the toilet seat where Satomi is[r]sitting is on the verge of overflowing with the dripping abundance of fluids.[pcm]

[大津]
I will give you sisters the worst possible outcome...[l][er]
After turning your insides into flesh tubes, I will suck out your brains through[r]your mouth and nose, so be prepared!![pcm]

☆pcmThe cries of Otsu's resentment and the sisters' melting screams, along with[r]the squelching sound of fluids, overlap and fill the private room, no, the[r]public restroom.[pcm]

From Satomi and Emma's expressions, reason had escaped them, and they had[r]transformed into pure pleasure-seeking females.[pcm]

Sticking out their tongues, dripping saliva scattered[r]around, even getting excited by each other's ahegao faces...[l][er]
The two women, whose normal thinking had been deprived, were indulging in[r]pleasure as they rubbed their bodies against each other.[pcm]

[大津]
Die, you filthy whores, die!! I will kill you!![l][er]
I will personally kill you, you sisters!![pcm]

The sisters' bodies bounce and the thrashing tentacles[r]expand suddenly, one size larger.[l][er]
Instinctively sensing what is approaching in the next moment, Satomi and Emma[r]thrust their hips forward, pressing their groins against each other.[pcm]

And,[pcm][イベント絵表示 file = "【イベントCG】c02_03.bmp"]

☆☆pcmA large amount of semen explodes along with screams.[pcm]

The rectum, vagina, uterus... all at once, a tremendous amount of heat was[r]pounding deep into their bodies, and the sisters were climaxing simultaneously.[pcm]

With a sound resembling the noise of excretion, a large amount of semen gushed[r]out from the four connecting parts, in liters, finally causing Satomi's lower[r]receptacle to overflow, and the viscous substance flowed down onto the floor.[pcm]

The sisters are writhing in deep despair, screaming in[r]agony.[l][er]
Their eyes roll back, almost showing the whites, saliva drips from their mouths,[r]mucus from their noses, and tears flow from their eyes.[pcm]

At the same time, they pressed their swollen bellies and groins against each[r]other, rubbing their clitorises together, unconsciously seeking further[r]pleasure.[pcm]

Rather, they thrust their hips even more, exhaling sweet breaths as if expecting[r]an even greater climax.[pcm]

[大津]
Hehehe, hahaha[pcm]Revenge accomplished, and Otsu laughs ominously.[l][er]
His expression cannot be read from his face covered in purple horns, but the[r]restless wriggling of the tentacles tells the story of his mental excitement.[pcm]

The tentacles thrash about, wriggling and expanding, filling[r]the room.[l][er]
Otsu, feeling cramped, naturally takes two, three steps back, completely[r]removing his body from the private room.[pcm]

... huh?[pcm]

Otsu, who doesn't understand what happened, raises a[r]bewildered voice...[l][er]
He looks alternately at himself and Emma and Satomi, who are left behind in the[r]private room.[pcm]

The tentacles are still entwined with Emma and Satomi...[l][er]
However, the thick trunk-like arms suddenly start melting into a purple liquid.[pcm]

And at the base of those tentacles, which is my crotch...[l][er]
There are the severed bases of the tentacles, the melting purple flesh, and[r]blood...[pcm]

[大津]
Ughhh, wahhh, ahhhh!?[pcm]

Severed... yes, severed. Otsu's tentacles were cut by[r]something, like a sharp blade.[l][er]
And it was done in one strike, in an instant.[pcm]

[大津]
Why, why is this...?[pcm]

Otsu, who is in a panic, kneels down and holds his crotch.[l][er]
However, the liquefaction of his body and the bleeding do not stop.[pcm]
My body shouldn't be decaying like this[pcm][大津]
Why, why, whyy!! Am I not an immortal body?[l][er]
Whyy...[pcm]

[クイーン]
[voice file = "c02q__01.ogg"]
... Seems like quite a low-level demon in terms of modification.[pcm]

A voice is heard... Otsu looks up.[pcm]

There stood a young girl.[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】窮地.ogg"]

Braided hair and glasses... A petite girl, barely 150cm[r]tall...[l][er]
Wearing the uniform of Hachimiya Academy, in the hand of that girl, is a knife[r]with a glass-like, green blade.[pcm]

It didn't look like a weapon that could sever Otsu's[r]tentacles, but...[l][er]
However, Otsu instinctively sensed it.[l][er]
'That's what cut them.[pcm]
'[pcm][大津]
Y-You, y-y-y-you...[pcm]

The one who shouldn't have appeared, the one who shouldn't[r]have been there, appeared right in front of me.[l][er]
In such a shocking moment, Otsu trembles and convulses all over his body.[pcm]

The girl with glasses on one side was throwing a[r]terrifyingly cold gaze at Otsu the whole time.[l][er]
It was a relentlessly icy stare that went beyond anger and[r]contempt.[l][er]
Even if it wasn't directed at Otsu, it would send shivers down anyone's spine.[pcm]

[クイーン]
[voice file = "c02q__02.ogg"]
DiepcmIn a brief statement, the girl tightened her grip on the knife.[pcm]

[大津]
Uwaaaah, aaaaahhhhh!![pcm]

With a scream filled with fear, Otsu ran past the girl and continued running[r]outside the public restroom.[pcm]

In an instant... With superhuman leg strength, the sound of footsteps quickly[r]fades away and becomes inaudible.[pcm]

[音楽フェードアウト time = "1000"]

The girl listened without turning around...[l][er]
but eventually, she let out a short sigh and put away the[r]knife.[l][er]
The green blade melted away in an instant, leaving only the grip in her hand.[pcm]

The girl peered into the private room and confirmed that the[r]tentacles that had violated Emma and Satomi had completely[r]liquefied and disappeared.[l][er]
She then walked towards Devi and Noch, who were collapsed against the wall.[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】優しい雰囲気.ogg"]

[クイーン]
[voice file = "c02q__03.ogg"]
Hey, are you alive?[pcm]

[デヴィ]
No... I'm dead...[pcm]

[ノッホ]
Thank goodness, Queen... I seriously thought I was going to die...[pcm]

[デヴィ]
No... I'm dead... I'm really dead, right...?[pcm]

The girl, relieved to see the two of them safe despite coughing, took out a[r]smartphone from her pocket.[pcm]

[クイーン]
[voice file = "c02q__04.ogg"]
It's settled. ... Yes. The rest will be left to another.[l][er]
... Yes. I don't know about that.[l][er]
... Hmm. Oh, and also, we should call an ambulance...[l][er]
and the police. ... Yes. ... Yes.[pcm]

The girl, after finishing conveying her message to the person on the other end[r]of the call, left Devi and Noch lying there and headed towards the private room.[pcm]

The girl looked down at Emma and Satomi, who were still[r]overlapping and breathing heavily in a daze...[l][er]
She let out a troubled laugh.[pcm]

[クイーン]
[voice file = "c02q__05.ogg"]
Impressive. I respect you. ...[l][er]
Because you saved me, so please hang in there a little longer.[pcm]

The girl's murmurs were not heard by the two.[l][er]
However, it seemed that only the atmosphere conveyed the[r]fact that they had escaped from the crisis, and before long,[r]the two lost consciousness...[l][er]
and fell into a deep sleep.[pcm]

[音楽フェードアウト time = "1000"]

…[pcm]… ……[pcm]… ………[pcm][イベント絵表示 file = "【イベント】黒.BMP"]
[音楽 file = "【BGM】事件の結末.ogg"]

Let's talk about what happened while I was unconscious.[pcm]

While I was buying time against Sakagawa, Devi and Noch, the Temperance Unit,[r]safely evacuated Emma and her foster parents, who are her uncle and aunt, to a[r]secure location outside the city.[pcm]

At the same time, Detective Natsuno tracked down the men of[r]the Otsu faction who abducted me and myself based on my[r]location information...[l][er]
As a result, the organization led by Otsu collapsed, creating a foothold.[pcm]

The first place that was identified was the brothel where I[r]was taken...[l][er]
It seems that by the time Detective Natsuno and the others[r]intervened, I had already been taken outside.[l][er]
However, Sakagawa's involvement was revealed from the evidence left behind in[r]the room.[pcm]

The police raid on the brothel and the timing may be different, but Sakagawa was[r]arrested by the police at the school before it started.[pcm]

He was arrested at the scene on charges of assault...[l][er]
It turns out that after that, Professor Haruda managed to[r]subdue Sakagawa with sheer determination and reported him to[r]the police.[l][er]
I heard later that he is a third-degree black belt in judo, quite skilled.[pcm]

Initially, Sakagawa, who was initially nonchalant and uncooperative during the[r]interrogation due to being suspected of simple assault, was arrested along with[r]his accomplices who were incapacitated by Devi and Noch, after the discovery of[r]the brothel.[pcm]

Additionally, thanks to Emma's testimony, the culprit[r]finally confessed.[l][er]
They confessed to their involvement in the disappearance case and revealed all[r]the hiding places that the Otsu faction had within the city.[pcm]

The discovery of the four missing students who were being[r]held captive in the warehouse district, especially, was[r]noteworthy.[l][er]
It seems that while I was sleeping, it caused quite a commotion in the world.[pcm]

The students were found in a state of drug-induced coma, but[r]it is said that they are gradually recovering.[l][er]
It is said that everyone will be able to return to their[r]normal lives within this year...[l][er]
However, there will still be other issues apart from their physical condition.[pcm]

The healing of their emotional wounds will depend on the[r]efforts of the adults from now on...[l][er]
High school students are still children.[l][er]
It is impossible for them to recover from the wounds caused by being involved in[r]such an incident on their own.[pcm]

As for that, all we can do is pray that the best possible choices will be made[r]for the students who have been victims from now on.[pcm]

…pcmIt is necessary to explain why Detective Natsuno was able to obtain my[r]'location information' and subsequently locate the brothel where I was taken.[pcm]

This is based on my third strategy.[pcm]

On the morning of the day when the operation was carried out, while I was on my[r]way to school, I swallowed a single capsule pill.[pcm]

That capsule does not contain drugs.[l][er]
It's a miniaturized transmitter.[pcm]

Our investigators at Augen und Ohr are required to carry emergency distress[r]signal transmitters at all times in situations where communication is not[r]possible.[pcm]

The capsule is normally in a non-operational state, but after being dissolved[r]through oral ingestion, it starts functioning through a chemical reaction with[r]gastric fluid.[pcm]

However, since the power source is the weak electrolyte of[r]gastric fluid, the transmission is designed to be ultra-[r]energy efficient, with a signal sent every 30 minutes.[l][er]
However, it ultimately loses functionality within about half[r]a day at most, as it cannot withstand the gastric fluid.[l][er]
Therefore, it is difficult to say that it is a versatile device.[pcm]

Moreover, a dedicated app is required to receive the[r]signal...[l][er]
It was originally an item with little use in solo missions[r]like this one, but I gave up on achieving the mission[r]through legitimate means...[l][er]
In other words, the moment I sought external assistance, its usefulness came[r]into play.[pcm]

On the day I revealed all of the operation, Detective[r]Natsuno had installed the receiving app for me in advance...[l][er]
I had already explained all the flaws of the transmitter, in other words, the[r]difficulty of pinpointing my location in real-time.[pcm]

He, with the cooperation of willing members within the[r]police, monitored the situation where Emma was being[r]protected by the Temperance Unit and, relying on my[r]unreliable location information, managed to discover the[r]brothel...[l][er]
That's the gist of it.[pcm]

However, it goes without saying that this required a[r]considerable amount of determination.[l][er]
In simple terms, my strategy was to switch the hostage from Emma to myself...[pcm]

There is a possibility that the transmitter will malfunction earlier than[r]planned, a possibility of being killed once captured by the men, a possibility[r]that the members of the Temperance Unit may not realize the significance of this[r]location information, and even if they do, a possibility that they will not[r]share the information with Detective Natsuno...[pcm]

The number of possibilities is endless, but there was a[r]sufficient chance that I would truly be ruined or even[r]killed by various factors...[l][er]
This operation using the transmitter was something that could not be executed[r]without being prepared to lose my life.[pcm]

As a result, Detective Natsuno, Devi, and Noch brought me[r]into a public restroom in the park and managed to find me.[l][er]
I was able to survive by a narrow margin...[l][er]
Honestly, it was unexpected for Emma to come and try to help me.[pcm]

According to what I heard, Devi and Noch were apparently[r]questioned by Emma about their interaction with Detective[r]Natsuno, and once they obtained the location information[r]that they were being held in a public restroom, Emma made a[r]big fuss about wanting to be taken along with them.[l][er]

That child's courage... No, I can't even say I'm happy about[r]it.[l][er]
I kept her away to prevent her from experiencing something[r]terrible, but she willingly got involved...[l][er]
She's truly a troublesome child.[pcm]

But surely... I think she resembles me in that aspect.[l][er]
That child, surely, has the same restless blood flowing within her, just like[r]me.[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
There is a sighting report that they fled towards the old warehouse district on[r]the bay shore, but what happens after that...[pcm]

Detective Natsuno is sitting on a chair next to the hospital[r]bed, scratching his head.[l][er]
... His expression is still filled with fatigue, but I think[r]it's only natural.[l][er]
The case has been resolved for the time being, but it's not hard to imagine that[r]he has been working tirelessly day and night.[pcm]

The upper management of the Yamiya Police Station was[r]exposed by the media for accepting a large bribe from the[r]Otsu faction, and it's still causing a huge uproar.[l][er]
It's probably causing unnecessary work to increase like crazy.[pcm]

It's both grateful and embarrassing that you come to visit me lying in bed like[r]this every other day, but I honestly hope you don't push yourself too hard.[pcm]

Since the case has been resolved, I hope you don't overwork[r]yourself and end up dying from exhaustion.[l][er]
It would be a waste and it would also give me a bad feeling.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__26.ogg"]
Do you know who it is?[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
That too... Honestly, it's just a lot of unclear things.[l][er]
I'm starting to not even know if a person named Otsu Akiharu actually existed.[pcm]

Detective Natsuno, who let out a deep sigh, seemed to have[r]an air of resignation...[l][er]
or rather, an air of trying not to think too deeply.[pcm]

The vice principal of Yamiya Academy, Otsu Akiharu, who was[r]in a leading position in the incident, disappeared suddenly[r]after escaping from that public restroom.[l][er]
It has been three weeks since then, and there has been no trace of him.[pcm]

Detective Natsuno seems to indicate that there has been little progress in the[r]investigation, despite considering the possibility of fleeing abroad.[pcm]

Moreover, the identity of Otsu, who is still unknown, has become even more[r]complicated by the discovery of the body of a middle-aged man found in the[r]basement during the search of his home conducted as part of the investigation.[pcm]

The identity of the body, which was determined through[r]various examinations, is Otsu Akiharu.[l][er]
... It has been approximately three years since his death,[r]and it was already completely skeletal.[l][er]
The cause of death is unknown, but there is a possibility of poisoning based on[r]the residue.[pcm]

A skeletal corpse, determined to be Otsu, who had been missing for three years,[r]was found in the basement of Otsu's escaped home...[pcm]

If we use our imagination, various delusions are possible, but if we take this[r]fact straight, it means that the man I met, named Otsu, was a completely[r]different person who impersonated the vice principal of Yamiya Academy, Otsu[r]Akiharu.[pcm]

It may explain why a man who had been quietly working as a[r]teacher suddenly got involved in heinous crimes such as[r]human trafficking...[l][er]
However, there are still questions about the circumstances of the switch, and[r]why no one around noticed the substitution at all.[pcm]

Indeed, he was a man who could transform into such a[r]'monster'.[l][er]
If someone were to say that he could transform into anyone,[r]I wouldn't be able to deny it.[l][er]
Honestly, even I can't be confident whether that figure that remains in the[r]corner of my memory was real or not.[pcm]

It was a situation that was too detached from reality...[l][er]
If there were no testimonies from others, I wouldn't doubt that it was a[r]hallucination caused by the drugs I was forced to inhale.[pcm]

However, I have kept the information about him[r]'transforming' a secret from Detective Natsuno.[l][er]
It's such a detached from reality story, and both Emma and I have been strongly[r]requested to keep it confidential by the Temperance Unit.[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
How are you feeling, Shina-san?[l][er]
Your complexion seems to have improved quite a bit.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__27.ogg"]
Thanks to you, I managed somehow...[l][er]
I'm already getting a headache thinking about what to write in the report for[r]this matter.[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
We both have our fair share of troubles, don't we?[pcm]

Ha ha, Detective Natsuno weakly laughs...[l][er]
I owe him a few favors.[pcm]

My main job... being an agent of an investigation company, and the fact that I[r]infiltrated the school under the guise of a teacher as part of my mission, I owe[r]a great debt for most of the issues being overlooked.[pcm]

Ideally, there could have been a situation where the legal[r]department of the headquarters and the Japanese police and[r]prosecutors would have been in a heated argument over how to[r]handle me, which is something I don't even want to think[r]about.[l][er]
But thanks to that, at least for now, I can focus on[r]recovering.[l][er]
I am sincerely grateful for this.[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
If I delve too much into it, it might become sexual[r]harassment, so I'll refrain from doing so.[l][er]
Please take care not to push yourself too hard.[l][er]
It would be a source of hope for people like us, if someone like you, Shina-san,[r]stays healthy.[pcm]

Detective Natsuno often refers to himself as a fool.[l][er]
However... honestly, I don't think so.[l][er]
I continued to pursue the missing persons case without[r]succumbing to the bribes from Otsu and others.[l][er]
The fact that I survived is also thanks to this person who clung to the case.[pcm]

He may be foolish in a negative sense, but in a positive[r]sense, he is straightforward.[l][er]
Despite his unimpressive appearance, I feel that he is a person with[r]determination.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__28.ogg"]
Detective Natsuno, please make sure to get enough sleep.[l][er]
You have really bad eye bags.[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
I will handle it. ... I really want to lie down and sleep[r]soon.[l][er]
In that regard, I truly envy you, Shina-san.[pcm]

I chuckled at Detective Natsuno, who sighed and slumped his shoulders.[pcm]

The color of the autumn-like sky outside the window was dazzling when I shifted[r]my gaze to the scenery.[pcm]

Emma was also hospitalized in the same hospital for three[r]weeks, but she was discharged earlier.[l][er]
I myself was in a coma for the first week, so this is actually the first time we[r]are talking properly since the incident.[pcm]

Emma's voice sounds tense... but at the same time, I can feel a certain level of[r]relaxation.[pcm]

At least, I don't feel any trace of the attitude that would reject me like when[r]we talked in the classroom before.[pcm]
