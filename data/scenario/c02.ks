[男A]
"Sorry, Sensei."[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__01.ogg"]
"Ugh, aahhh..."[pcm]

Satomi, pushed down onto the dirty floor by a man, was about[r]
to be assaulted. At that moment... the men heard footsteps[r]
approaching from outside.[pcm]

In the midst of the chaotic frenzy, the men's vigilance was[r]
always strong. Normally, this time of day would be deserted[r]
in the secluded corner of the park... but involuntarily, the[r]
tension heightened.[pcm]

The footsteps were light and fast, but filled with urgency.[r]
It was immediately clear that it wasn't a runner who liked[r]
to run on the outskirts of the park.[pcm]

Furthermore, from behind those fast footsteps, several...[pcm]

[男A]
"Hey"[pcm]

[男D]
"Aah..."[pcm]

"One of the urged men skillfully dragged Satomi's body and[r]
pulled her into a private room. Meanwhile, the footsteps[r]
continued straight towards the public restroom, getting[r]
closer and closer..."[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】悲壮な決意.ogg"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__01.ogg"]
"Big sister!!"[pcm]

The men were truly taken aback by the appearance of a high[r]
school girl who came with a voice that was almost a scream.[pcm]

Satomi Emma... chosen by Sakagawa as the final target, a[r]
member of the swimming club. There's no way I wouldn't know.[r]
All the men here have been summoned by Sakagawa and even[r]
gang-raped this girl.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__02.ogg"]
"Where is my sister...!!?"[pcm]

Satomi, who had been thrown into a private room, was not[r]
visible from Emma's desperate and intense expression.[r]
However, it was immediately apparent from the foul odor[r]
filling the restroom what was taking place.[pcm]

[男C]
"Hey, hey Emma-chan... what's wrong? Why are you alone?"[pcm]

[男D]
"It's dangerous to be out this late at night... or maybe you[r]
want to have some fun with us again?"[pcm]

At the moment when the man reached out his hand towards[r]
Emma,[pcm]

[音楽ストップ]

[男D]
"Habyu"[pcm]

From behind Emma, there was a loud explosion and a flash...[pcm]

The man, squeezing out a harsh "sound" that couldn't even be[r]
called a voice from his throat, was slammed onto the tiled[r]
floor of the restroom in a twisted position, rotating two[r]
and a half times in mid-air...[pcm]

Silence dominates the public restroom... Even Emma's eyes[r]
widen. The men's expressions freeze, unable to comprehend[r]
the momentary event that just occurred before their eyes,[r]
they stare wide-eyed.[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】走る.ogg"]

[デヴィ]
"Hey, stop right there! Don't move!"[pcm]

Two sets of footsteps approaching late... revealed by the[r]
light leaking from the public restroom, their figures were a[r]
pair of men, one wide and short, and the other narrow and[r]
tall.[pcm]

The men, Devi and Nocho, who are communication officers of[r]
the Temperance Unit, are holding what appears to be shotgun-[r]
like weapons in their hands.[pcm]

[ノッホ]
"Emma-chan, you're in too much of a hurry... Ah, it's[r]
tight..."[pcm]

[デヴィ]
"Haah, haah, I'm getting skinny..."[pcm]

Devi and Nocho were panting heavily, exhausted... After all,[r]
they had been chasing Emma at full speed from the parking[r]
lot of the park. The athletic legs of the youthful sports[r]
club member had thoroughly worn them out.[pcm]

[男B]
"You guys..."[pcm]

[ノッホ]
"Haah, haah... Don't move, you punks. It's rubber bullets,[r]
but they're not for play. If you don't want to end up like[r]
that guy, don't resist unnecessarily."[pcm]

Nocho points with his chin at one of the men who was blown[r]
away earlier. ...On the floor of the restroom, he is[r]
trembling and convulsing while bleeding from his mouth.[pcm]

The high-impact material used to suppress rioters... It hit[r]
the man's lower jaw, shattering his jawbone and teeth into[r]
pieces.[pcm]

[デヴィ]
"Emma-chan, just step back a little."[pcm]

Emma, who is also confused like the men, is temporarily[r]
moved outside the restroom, and Devi and Nocho step forward[r]
while panting heavily.[pcm]

[ノッホ]
"I have 4 shots left. My partner also has 4 shots left... I[r]
think it's enough to take care of all of you like that guy[r]
over there... What are we going to do?"[pcm]

[デヴィ]
"Phew... Just to explain, it's a choice between getting[r]
caught and experiencing pain, or getting caught without[r]
experiencing pain. I'd prefer to take a little break if[r]
possible..."[pcm]

"Intrusion, and two armed men... Even the men themselves are[r]
bewildered by the sudden situation, looking at each other's[r]
faces in confusion."[pcm]

But... there is no need to think. Their choice has already[r]
been determined.[pcm]

The third option... eliminate the intruders and escape from[r]
here. That's all. There is absolutely no intention of being[r]
caught quietly.[pcm]

Originally, these men are accustomed to violence, no, they[r]
specialize in violence. Even if the opponent is armed, there[r]
are only two of them. Above all, they have a hostage to use[r]
as a shield.[pcm]

[男A]
"The ones who will suffer... are you guys..."[pcm]

[ノッホ]
"Ahh..."[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】暴力.ogg"]

The moment when one of the men reached out to Satomi, who[r]
had just been thrown into the restroom... The gun held by[r]
the intruder fired again.[pcm]

[男A]
"Gyah"[pcm]

[男F]
"Hebuuu"[pcm]

The flash, the sound of impact, screams... It repeated five[r]
times, and in an instant, the inside of the restroom became[r]
quiet.[pcm]

The men had made a mistake in their judgment of the[r]
situation.[pcm]

Devi and Nocho were more accustomed to violence than them,[r]
and from the beginning, they intended to shoot and[r]
incapacitate everyone. ... The moment they stepped into the[r]
restroom, it was as if their defeat had already been[r]
determined.[pcm]

[音楽フェードアウト time = "1000"]

Finally, the restroom became quiet... Devi and Nocho, who[r]
were waiting behind, urged Emma. Emma... somewhat hesitant[r]
due to the actions of the men she accompanied, stepped into[r]
the restroom once again.[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】リグレット.ogg"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__03.ogg"]
"Big sister... big sister...!!"[pcm]

"Stepping over the men who were collapsed, bleeding, and[r]
trembling in fear, she immediately noticed the presence of a[r]
private room."[pcm]

There, lying in a pitiful state, was the figure of Satomi.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__04.ogg"]
"Big sister..."[pcm]

Satomi, covered in sticky slime, emitting a terrible odor,[r]
and wearing a vacant expression, Emma desperately lifts her[r]
sister up and sits her on the toilet seat for the time[r]
being.[pcm]

Satomi's condition, which even an amateur could recognize as[r]
dangerous, made it impossible for Emma to hold back her[r]
tears.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__05.ogg"]
"Pull yourself together... Big sister... Big sister..."[pcm]

Emma was somewhat informed about the "plan" of Satomi and[r]
Detective Natsuno through Devi and Nocho on the way to the[r]
park.[pcm]

The primary objective of the plan is to ensure the safety of[r]
Emma and her uncle and aunt, which is why Satomi willingly[r]
took on the extremely dangerous role as a decoy.[pcm]

Satomi decided on this plan knowing that Emma was in a[r]
dangerous state...[pcm]

In order to prevent this from happening, I desperately tried[r]
to act cold and keep my distance. I made up my mind to[r]
behave like a stranger because I didn't want to get[r]
involved.[pcm]

Emma's head was already a mess, filled with misery,[r]
frustration, but above all, worry and pride for her sister.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__02.ogg"]
"Ugh... Ahh..."[pcm]

Emma regains her composure at Satomi's groans. When she[r]
looks, she sees Satomi's eyes slightly open, staring[r]
intently at Emma's face.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__06.ogg"]
"Big sister..."[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__03.ogg"]
"Why are you here...?"[pcm]

"In a voice that seemed to fade away, she asked... or[r]
rather, it was almost like murmuring. But instead of[r]
answering, Emma tightly held Satomi's hand."[pcm]

[デヴィ]
"Was it worth running with the determination to die?"[pcm]

[ノッホ]
"Exactly."[pcm]

The men who had fallen were tied up with their hands behind[r]
their backs, as Devi and Nocho smirked and laughed together.[r]
It was a simple makeshift method of tying their thumbs[r]
together with a zip tie, but it was deemed sufficient for[r]
the unconscious men.[pcm]

[デヴィ]
"As for the retrieval of these guys... what should we do?[r]
Should we ask Zoaan to bring a car, or should we ask that[r]
detective over there..."[pcm]

[音楽ストップ]

[？？？]
"No, we'll dismantle them here."[pcm]

The sudden voice that intruded made Devi, Nocho, and Emma[r]
all flinch and tremble.[pcm]

Devi and Nocho looked up... There was a man standing at the[r]
entrance of the restroom.[pcm]

The middle-aged man, slightly overweight in a suit. ...His[r]
face filled with hatred and anger, his eyes burning with[r]
intensity.[pcm]

Otsu Akiharu, Vice Principal of Yamiya Academy. He is[r]
considered the mastermind behind the disappearance[r]
incident...[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】狂気の芽生え"]

[大津]
"......The plan that I had carefully crafted... If this had[r]
succeeded, I would have been welcomed by Goldberg... But[r]
now... "[pcm]

Trembling and shaking, Otsu's body... Devi and Nocho raise[r]
their shotguns again, sensing something unusual.[pcm]

However, Otsu seemed completely unaffected by the two's[r]
behavior. Instead, anger welled up even deeper in his[r]
expression... Purple mucus sprayed and dripped from his[r]
forehead, cheeks, and neck.[pcm]

[大津]
"I should have twisted and killed all of you from the[r]
beginning... The police! The teachers! The stupid pawns! The[r]
Queen, everything, everything, everything,[r]
eeeeeeehhhhhhhh!!"[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】大津の正体.ogg"]

Otsu's body undergoes a transformation as he spits out[r]
sticky mucus that clings to the back of his throat. The[r]
purple mucus assimilates with his body, tearing apart his[r]
suit from the inside and growing into a gigantic form...[pcm]

[デヴィ]
"Hey hey hey, this is bad, no way..."[pcm]

[ノッホ]
"No mistake, it's magic."[pcm]

The words of Nocho were interrupted, and a vibration and[r]
impact pierced through the public restroom.[pcm]

The next moment, Devi and Nocho's bodies were forcefully[r]
slammed against the tiled wall of the restroom... Both of[r]
them collapsed together.[pcm]

Otsu was blown away by countless branches that "sprouted"[r]
from him... They were indescribable, flesh-like "tentacles".[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__07.ogg"]
"Huh... Wha, what..."[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__04.ogg"]
"Emma... Run... Please run..."[pcm]

Emma, who had been witnessing the situation fragmentarily[r]
inside the private room, was perplexed, while Satomi kept[r]
repeating incoherent words.[pcm]

Satomi's consciousness was hazy, but she instinctively[r]
understood that the situation in front of her was not[r]
ordinary. Even though she didn't know the reason why Emma[r]
was there, she knew that it was not a good situation for her[r]
to be in.[pcm]

However, Emma starts to move... No, even if she could move,[r]
she couldn't leave Satomi behind... In front of the entrance[r]
to the private room, Otsu, who had undergone a[r]
"transformation," stood in the way.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__08.ogg"]
"Huh... What...?"[pcm]

Emma can only be speechless at that sight.[pcm]

Otsu's body had grown about twice its size. A dark purple,[r]
robust body, a mass resembling a shell covering half of the[r]
head, and numerous "tentacles" extending from the groin...[pcm]

The appearance, which can only be described as "monstrous,"[r]
was so unreal that it completely robbed Emma of her thoughts[r]
in an instant.[pcm]

*Hシーン

[イベント絵表示 file = "【イベントCG】c02_01.bmp"]

[大津]
"I'll turn you all into trash meat right here!"[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__09.ogg"]
"Hiiii, iiiii, yaaahhhh!?!?!"[pcm]

The tentacles rushed into the private room all at once,[r]
entwining around Emma and Satomi's bodies, as dripping slime[r]
wetted their bodies.[pcm]

Emma, unable to help but sense it, realizes what they are[r]
trying to do as they possess a terrifying pressure, mass,[r]
and an unexpected dexterity. They begin to strip Emma of her[r]
clothes and simultaneously restrain her limbs.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__10.ogg"]
"Stop it! Let go!!"[pcm]

[大津]
"Shut up!! If Sakagawa hadn't been fixated on you, we[r]
wouldn't have ended up in this troublesome situation...!!"[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__05.ogg"]
"Please... forgive me... Emma will... take care of[r]
everything... so...[pcm]

[大津]
"I told you to shut up!!"[pcm]

Satomi's tentacles, which had entwined around Otsu, swelled[r]
and tightened. They grew about one size larger and dug into[r]
her wrists and legs. Satomi's eyes widened as she recoiled[r]
in shock.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__06.ogg"]
"Ugh, ahhhhhh...!!"[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__11.ogg"]
"Big sister!! Stop it, this is...!!"[pcm]

[大津]
"If it weren't for you all, we wouldn't be in this[r]
mess...!!"[pcm]

The tips of the tentacles are pressed against Emma and[r]
Satomi's groins, accompanied by a sticky squelching sound.[r]
They intend to penetrate all four of their orifices[r]
simultaneously - their vaginas and anuses.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__12.ogg"]
"Huh..."[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__07.ogg"]
"Stop... Only Emma... If you're going to do it, do it to[r]
me..."[pcm]

[大津]
"Dig into my stomach and die!!"[pcm]

With screams, the tentacles were simultaneously thrust into[r]
the sisters. And...[pcm]

[イベント絵表示 file = "【イベントCG】c02_02.bmp"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__08.ogg"]
"Ughhh"[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__09.ogg"]
"Yaaaaahhhhh, aaaaahhhhh!!"[pcm]

Emma's and Satomi's voices echoed, and their bodies were[r]
violently thrust upwards.[pcm]

The thickness, length, and flexibility that cannot be[r]
compared to a human penis... Expanding each of their holes[r]
to the limit, simultaneously filling and penetrating them[r]
tightly to the very depths, conforming to their individual[r]
shapes.[pcm]

Satomi and Emma have both been thoroughly tormented by men,[r]
but the intensity of this penetration was something they[r]
were experiencing for the first time. It was incredibly[r]
intense, and also...[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__13.ogg"]
"Gururu... Ji... What... is this...!?"[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__10.ogg"]
"Hii, guu, oohh, hiiii☆☆"[pcm]

The intense, melting voices of the females, overflowing with[r]
agony... It was as if their entire bodies were being[r]
forcefully seized by pleasure, surging from their vaginas[r]
and anuses. In an instant, their faces flushed with a[r]
shocking pleasure.[pcm]

[大津]
"Die in madness, you female pigs!"[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__14.ogg"]
"No, stop, ahh, ahh, no, no, nooo, ahh, ahh, ahhhh☆"[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__11.ogg"]
"Ugh, ohh, guh, ohh!!☆☆ Shuggo, ohh, ohh, ohh!!☆☆"[pcm]

The rough piston begins, and the four flesh holes open wide,[r]
making squelching sounds... Not only the tentacle's slime,[r]
but also a large amount of love juice is being rapidly[r]
secreted.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__12.ogg"]
"Guh, ahh, nooo, stop, j- don't, nuuuhhhh☆"[pcm]

Emma's voice, as well as the exhausted Satomi's, resounded[r]
with pleasure. It was not something as simple as being[r]
stimulated in the weak parts of their sensitive spots.[pcm]

The intense pleasure that feels like every nerve and brain[r]
in their entire body is being directly violated through[r]
their vagina and rectum... Even just the tentacles alone are[r]
abnormal enough, but this rapid stimulation is incredibly[r]
surreal.[pcm]

The aphrodisiac... Satomi and Emma have already experienced[r]
the effects firsthand. The same effects as that drug are[r]
being brought about by the slime secreted by the tentacles.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__15.ogg"]
"Higuu, yaaahh, daaahh, meeehhhh☆☆ This is... strange...[r]
oohh, guh, aahh☆☆"[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__13.ogg"]
"Emma, no, don't give up, ehh ehh ehhhh☆ Ohh, ohh, guh, ahh[r]
ahhhh☆☆"[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__16.ogg"]
"Oh... it's coming... hi, it's intense!!☆☆ Ah, ah, ah,[r]
ahhhh!!☆☆"[pcm]

Satomi and Emma, with vulgar expressions they have never[r]
made before, gasp and writhe while desperately encouraging[r]
each other. However, the tentacles, as if mocking their[r]
attempts to hold onto their sanity, became more violent.[pcm]

The tentacles wriggle like whips, and the impact causes a[r]
loud "snap" inside their holes, bursting open.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__14.ogg"]
"Ugh, ahhhh!!"[pcm]

The sisters writhed in agony from the violent impact[r]
directly applied to their bodies. They arched their bodies[r]
as much as possible, spewing saliva and love juices as they[r]
thrashed about.[pcm]

[大津]
"Such an insolent hole... I'll make it all messy...!!"[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__15.ogg"]
"Ahh, ahh, guh, hiiii!!"[pcm]

The whip-like strikes of the tentacles, hitting directly[r]
inside their vagina and rectum, resonate intensely in their[r]
bodies, especially in their uterus, creating a pleasure that[r]
is not just sweet, but overwhelmingly intense.[pcm]

The four holes that engulfed the tentacles are wet and[r]
sticky with foaming love juices and intestinal fluids,[r]
telling the depth of their pleasure.[pcm]

And, that expression...[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__17.ogg"]
"Haah, haah, haaah... Huh, uuhh...☆"[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__16.ogg"]
"Hiiii, hiiii... uhhhh, huuuhh...☆"[pcm]

"Despite being exposed to intense attacks, their faces were[r]
soaked with a melting ecstasy. The sisters were both excited[r]
by the expressions of female pleasure they had never seen[r]
before."[pcm]

And as if seeing through the confusion and corruption of the[r]
two, Otsu's attacks continue.[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__18.ogg"]
"No, stop, there, ahhh, ahhh!! Please stop, deep inside my[r]
butt, ahhh, ahhh, it feels so good, so good, ahhh, ahhh,[r]
ahhh!!"[pcm]

"While being forcefully penetrated in the anus with a[r]
squelching sound, and relentlessly thrusting into the depths[r]
of the vagina... Normally, such an intense attack would[r]
induce nausea, but it rapidly corrodes Emma's mind into an[r]
overwhelming pleasure."[pcm]

The aphrodisiac itself is the same as that drug, but the[r]
tentacle's attack sets it apart in terms of the method of[r]
administration.[pcm]

The experience they had until now was inhalation through the[r]
nasal passage, but this time, it is directly applied to the[r]
sensitive spot by the tentacles, enhancing the sensitivity[r]
of the sensitive spot and rapidly being absorbed into the[r]
bloodstream.[pcm]

[大津]
"Hehe, little by little, I'll twist it deeper and deeper...[r]
In the end, I'll make you spit out the tentacle from your[r]
mouth, so be prepared...!!"[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__17.ogg"]
"Ah, y-yes, ah, ah, it feels so good, s-so good!!"[pcm]

The tentacles violating her anus thrashed around, attempting[r]
to reach her colon, causing Satomi to scream and shake her[r]
head violently from side to side.[pcm]

At the same time as the pain, an intoxicating pleasure... In[r]
her hazy consciousness, she realizes that Otsu is trying to[r]
fulfill his declaration.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__18.ogg"]
"Ah, gi-, gu-, ahhhh!!☆☆"[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__19.ogg"]
"Big sister, no, ah, ah, stop, don't, don't, my butt won't[r]
take it, no, ah, ah, ah, ah!!☆☆"[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__19.ogg"]
"Ah, ma-, don't, I can't, I'm going to die, I'm going to[r]
believe it☆☆"[pcm]

The relentless assault of the tentacles, penetrating deep[r]
into the rectum, thrusting into the uterus, occasionally[r]
mixed with internal whipping... The tentacles are about to[r]
completely destroy the sisters.[pcm]

The thrashing tentacles, covered in secretions and the[r]
bodily fluids overflowing from the sisters, are leaving[r]
sticky trails, and the toilet seat where Satomi is sitting[r]
is on the verge of overflowing with the dripping abundance[r]
of fluids.[pcm]

[大津]
"I will give you sisters the worst possible outcome... After[r]
turning your insides into flesh tubes, I will suck out your[r]
brains through your mouth and nose, so be prepared!!"[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__20.ogg"]
"No, stop, ah, ah, it's no good, I'm going to die, I'm going[r]
to die!!☆"[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__20.ogg"]
"Ah, ah, ah, ah, I'm, I'm going to, going to, I'm going to,[r]
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to die!!☆"[pcm]

The cries of Otsu's resentment and the sisters' melting[r]
screams, along with the squelching sound of fluids, overlap[r]
and fill the private room, no, the public restroom.[pcm]

From Satomi and Emma's expressions, reason had escaped them,[r]
and they had transformed into pure pleasure-seeking females.[pcm]

"Sticking out their tongues, dripping saliva scattered[r]
around, even getting excited by each other's ahegao faces...[r]
The two women, whose normal thinking had been deprived, were[r]
indulging in pleasure as they rubbed their bodies against[r]
each other."[pcm]

[大津]
"Die, you filthy whores, die!! I will kill you!! I will[r]
personally kill you, you sisters!!"[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__21.ogg"]
"Ugh, ughhh, ughhh, I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I[r]
can't, I can't, ahhh!!☆☆"[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__21.ogg"]
"I'm going, I'm, going, ahhhh!! I'm going to die, I'm going[r]
to die, shhh, ahhhh!!"[pcm]

The sisters' bodies bounce and the thrashing tentacles[r]
expand suddenly, one size larger. Instinctively sensing what[r]
is approaching in the next moment, Satomi and Emma thrust[r]
their hips forward, pressing their groins against each[r]
other.[pcm]

And,[pcm]

[イベント絵表示 file = "【イベントCG】c02_03.bmp"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__22.ogg"]
"Ughhh"[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__23.ogg"]
"Ugh, ugh ughhh~~ ~~Ahhh!!☆☆"[pcm]

"A large amount of semen explodes along with screams."[pcm]

The rectum, vagina, uterus... all at once, a tremendous[r]
amount of heat was pounding deep into their bodies, and the[r]
sisters were climaxing simultaneously.[pcm]

"With a sound resembling the noise of excretion, a large[r]
amount of semen gushed out from the four connecting parts,[r]
in liters, finally causing Satomi's lower receptacle to[r]
overflow, and the viscous substance flowed down onto the[r]
floor."[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__22.ogg"]
"Hiiii, hiiii, hii... Ahh, ahhhh☆☆ I'm... cumming... ohh,[r]
ohh☆☆"[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__24.ogg"]
"Ughhh... Ughhh...☆☆ I'm... dying... I... can't...☆☆"[pcm]

The sisters are writhing in deep despair, screaming in[r]
agony. Their eyes roll back, almost showing the whites,[r]
saliva drips from their mouths, mucus from their noses, and[r]
tears flow from their eyes.[pcm]

At the same time, they pressed their swollen bellies and[r]
groins against each other, rubbing their clitorises[r]
together, unconsciously seeking further pleasure.[pcm]

[大津]
"Gukuku... First, one shot... Next, penetrate through all of[r]
the intestines..."[pcm]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c02e__23.ogg"]
"Ughhh, gii...☆☆"[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__25.ogg"]
"Guehh...☆☆"[pcm]

The tentacles are trying to penetrate even deeper, despite[r]
the continued ejaculation... The sisters groan with their[r]
eyes rolled back, but they can no longer even show any[r]
resistance.[pcm]

"Rather, they thrust their hips even more, exhaling sweet[r]
breaths as if expecting an even greater climax."[pcm]

[大津]
"Hehehe, hahaha"[pcm]

Revenge accomplished, and Otsu laughs ominously. His[r]
expression cannot be read from his face covered in purple[r]
horns, but the restless wriggling of the tentacles tells the[r]
story of his mental excitement.[pcm]

The tentacles thrash about, wriggling and expanding, filling[r]
the room. Otsu, feeling cramped, naturally takes two, three[r]
steps back, completely removing his body from the private[r]
room.[pcm]

[大津]
"Fall into hell while gazing at heaven, you female pigs..."[pcm]

At that moment, Otsu exerted force to push the tentacles[r]
further into the sisters' intestines...[pcm]

[会話シーン file = "【背景】公衆便所(夜).png"]

Thud, a heavy sound, and Otsu suddenly lost his balance,[r]
stumbling in place.[pcm]

[大津]
"...huh?"[pcm]

Otsu, who doesn't understand what happened, raises a[r]
bewildered voice... He looks alternately at himself and Emma[r]
and Satomi, who are left behind in the private room.[pcm]

The tentacles are still entwined with Emma and Satomi...[r]
However, the thick trunk-like arms suddenly start melting[r]
into a purple liquid.[pcm]

And at the base of those tentacles, which is my crotch...[r]
There are the severed bases of the tentacles, the melting[r]
purple flesh, and blood...[pcm]

[大津]
"Ughhh, wahhh, ahhhh!?"[pcm]

"Severed... yes, severed. Otsu's tentacles were cut by[r]
something, like a sharp blade. And it was done in one[r]
strike, in an instant."[pcm]

[大津]
"Why, why is this...?"[pcm]

Otsu, who is in a panic, kneels down and holds his crotch.[r]
However, the liquefaction of his body and the bleeding do[r]
not stop. "My body shouldn't be decaying like this"[pcm]

[大津]
"Why, why, whyy!! Am I not an immortal body? Whyy..."[pcm]

[クイーン]
[voice file = "c02q__01.ogg"]
"...Seems like quite a low-level "demon" in terms of[r]
modification."[pcm]

A voice is heard... Otsu looks up.[pcm]

There stood a young girl.[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】窮地.ogg"]

"Braided hair and glasses... A petite girl, barely 150cm[r]
tall... Wearing the uniform of Hachimiya Academy, in the[r]
hand of that girl, is a knife with a glass-like, green[r]
blade."[pcm]

"It didn't look like a weapon that could sever Otsu's[r]
tentacles, but... However, Otsu instinctively sensed it.[r]
'That's what cut them.'"[pcm]

[大津]
"Y-You, y-y-y-you..."[pcm]

The one who shouldn't have appeared, the one who shouldn't[r]
have been there, appeared right in front of me. In such a[r]
shocking moment, Otsu trembles and convulses all over his[r]
body.[pcm]

The girl with glasses on one side was throwing a[r]
terrifyingly cold gaze at Otsu the whole time. It was a[r]
relentlessly icy stare that went beyond anger and contempt.[r]
Even if it wasn't directed at Otsu, it would send shivers[r]
down anyone's spine.[pcm]

[クイーン]
[voice file = "c02q__02.ogg"]
"Die"[pcm]

In a brief statement, the girl tightened her grip on the[r]
knife.[pcm]

[大津]
"Uwaaaah, aaaaahhhhh!!"[pcm]

With a scream filled with fear, Otsu ran past the girl and[r]
continued running outside the public restroom.[pcm]

In an instant... With superhuman leg strength, the sound of[r]
footsteps quickly fades away and becomes inaudible.[pcm]

[音楽フェードアウト time = "1000"]

The girl listened without turning around... but eventually,[r]
she let out a short sigh and put away the knife. The green[r]
blade melted away in an instant, leaving only the grip in[r]
her hand.[pcm]

The girl peered into the private room and confirmed that the[r]
tentacles that had violated Emma and Satomi had completely[r]
liquefied and disappeared. She then walked towards Devi and[r]
Noch, who were collapsed against the wall.[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】優しい雰囲気.ogg"]

[クイーン]
[voice file = "c02q__03.ogg"]
"Hey, are you alive?"[pcm]

[デヴィ]
"No... I'm dead..."[pcm]

[ノッホ]
"Thank goodness, Queen... I seriously thought I was going to[r]
die..."[pcm]

[デヴィ]
"No... I'm dead... I'm really dead, right...?"[pcm]

The girl, relieved to see the two of them safe despite[r]
coughing, took out a smartphone from her pocket.[pcm]

[クイーン]
[voice file = "c02q__04.ogg"]
"It's settled. ...Yes. The rest will be left to another.[r]
...Yes. I don't know about that. ...Hmm. Oh, and also, we[r]
should call an ambulance... and the police. ...Yes. ...Yes."[pcm]

The girl, after finishing conveying her message to the[r]
person on the other end of the call, left Devi and Noch[r]
lying there and headed towards the private room.[pcm]

The girl looked down at Emma and Satomi, who were still[r]
overlapping and breathing heavily in a daze... She let out a[r]
troubled laugh.[pcm]

[クイーン]
[voice file = "c02q__05.ogg"]
"Impressive. I respect you. ...Because you saved me, so[r]
please hang in there a little longer."[pcm]

The girl's murmurs were not heard by the two. However, it[r]
seemed that only the atmosphere conveyed the fact that they[r]
had escaped from the crisis, and before long, the two lost[r]
consciousness... and fell into a deep sleep.[pcm]

[イベント絵表示 file = "【イベント】黒.BMP"]
[音楽 file = "【BGM】事件の結末.ogg"]

Let's talk about what happened while I was unconscious.[pcm]

While I was buying time against Sakagawa, Devi and Noch, the[r]
Temperance Unit, safely evacuated Emma and her foster[r]
parents, who are her uncle and aunt, to a secure location[r]
outside the city.[pcm]

At the same time, Detective Natsuno tracked down the men of[r]
the Otsu faction who abducted me and myself based on my[r]
"location information"... As a result, the organization led[r]
by Otsu collapsed, creating a foothold.[pcm]

The first place that was identified was the brothel where I[r]
was taken... It seems that by the time Detective Natsuno and[r]
the others intervened, I had already been taken outside.[r]
However, Sakagawa's involvement was revealed from the[r]
evidence left behind in the room.[pcm]

The police raid on the brothel and the timing may be[r]
different, but Sakagawa was arrested by the police at the[r]
school before it started.[pcm]

"He was arrested at the scene on charges of assault... It[r]
turns out that after that, Professor Haruda managed to[r]
subdue Sakagawa with sheer determination and reported him to[r]
the police. I heard later that he is a third-degree black[r]
belt in judo, quite skilled."[pcm]

Initially, Sakagawa, who was initially nonchalant and[r]
uncooperative during the interrogation due to being[r]
suspected of simple assault, was arrested along with his[r]
accomplices who were incapacitated by Devi and Noch, after[r]
the discovery of the brothel.[pcm]

Additionally, thanks to Emma's testimony, the culprit[r]
finally confessed. They confessed to their involvement in[r]
the disappearance case and revealed all the hiding places[r]
that the Otsu faction had within the city.[pcm]

The discovery of the four missing students who were being[r]
held captive in the warehouse district, especially, was[r]
noteworthy. It seems that while I was sleeping, it caused[r]
quite a commotion in the world.[pcm]

The students were found in a state of drug-induced coma, but[r]
it is said that they are gradually recovering. It is said[r]
that everyone will be able to return to their normal lives[r]
within this year... However, there will still be other[r]
issues apart from their physical condition.[pcm]

The healing of their emotional wounds will depend on the[r]
efforts of the adults from now on... High school students[r]
are still children. It is impossible for them to recover[r]
from the wounds caused by being involved in such an incident[r]
on their own.[pcm]

"As for that, all we can do is pray that the best possible[r]
choices will be made for the students who have been victims[r]
from now on."[pcm]

…[pcm]

"It is necessary to explain why Detective Natsuno was able[r]
to obtain my 'location information' and subsequently locate[r]
the brothel where I was taken."[pcm]

This is based on my third strategy.[pcm]

On the morning of the day when the operation was carried[r]
out, while I was on my way to school, I swallowed a single[r]
capsule pill.[pcm]

That capsule does not contain drugs. It's a miniaturized[r]
transmitter.[pcm]

Our investigators at Augen und Ohr are required to carry[r]
emergency distress signal transmitters at all times in[r]
situations where communication is not possible.[pcm]

The capsule is normally in a non-operational state, but[r]
after being dissolved through oral ingestion, it starts[r]
functioning through a chemical reaction with gastric fluid.[pcm]

However, since the power source is the weak electrolyte of[r]
gastric fluid, the transmission is designed to be ultra-[r]
energy efficient, with a signal sent every 30 minutes.[r]
However, it ultimately loses functionality within about half[r]
a day at most, as it cannot withstand the gastric fluid.[r]
Therefore, it is difficult to say that it is a versatile[r]
device.[pcm]

"Moreover, a dedicated app is required to receive the[r]
signal... It was originally an item with little use in solo[r]
missions like this one, but I gave up on achieving the[r]
mission through legitimate means... In other words, the[r]
moment I sought external assistance, its usefulness came[r]
into play."[pcm]

On the day I revealed all of the operation, Detective[r]
Natsuno had installed the receiving app for me in advance...[r]
I had already explained all the flaws of the transmitter, in[r]
other words, the difficulty of pinpointing my location in[r]
real-time.[pcm]

He, with the cooperation of willing members within the[r]
police, monitored the situation where Emma was being[r]
protected by the Temperance Unit and, relying on my[r]
unreliable location information, managed to discover the[r]
brothel... That's the gist of it.[pcm]

However, it goes without saying that this required a[r]
considerable amount of determination. In simple terms, my[r]
strategy was to switch the hostage from Emma to myself...[pcm]

There is a possibility that the transmitter will malfunction[r]
earlier than planned, a possibility of being killed once[r]
captured by the men, a possibility that the members of the[r]
Temperance Unit may not realize the significance of this[r]
location information, and even if they do, a possibility[r]
that they will not share the information with Detective[r]
Natsuno...[pcm]

The number of possibilities is endless, but there was a[r]
sufficient chance that I would truly be ruined or even[r]
killed by various factors... This operation using the[r]
transmitter was something that could not be executed without[r]
being prepared to lose my life.[pcm]

As a result, Detective Natsuno, Devi, and Noch brought me[r]
into a public restroom in the park and managed to find me. I[r]
was able to survive by a narrow margin... Honestly, it was[r]
unexpected for Emma to come and try to help me.[pcm]

According to what I heard, Devi and Noch were apparently[r]
questioned by Emma about their interaction with Detective[r]
Natsuno, and once they obtained the location information[r]
that they were being held in a public restroom, Emma made a[r]
big fuss about wanting to be taken along with them.[r]

That child's courage... No, I can't even say I'm happy about[r]
it. I kept her away to prevent her from experiencing[r]
something terrible, but she willingly got involved... She's[r]
truly a troublesome child.[pcm]

"But surely... I think she resembles me in that aspect. That[r]
child, surely, has the same restless blood flowing within[r]
her, just like me."[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
"There is a sighting report that they fled towards the old[r]
warehouse district on the bay shore, but what happens after[r]
that..."[pcm]

Detective Natsuno is sitting on a chair next to the hospital[r]
bed, scratching his head. ...His expression is still filled[r]
with fatigue, but I think it's only natural. The case has[r]
been resolved for the time being, but it's not hard to[r]
imagine that he has been working tirelessly day and night.[pcm]

The upper management of the Yamiya Police Station was[r]
exposed by the media for accepting a large bribe from the[r]
Otsu faction, and it's still causing a huge uproar. It's[r]
probably causing unnecessary work to increase like crazy.[pcm]

It's both grateful and embarrassing that you come to visit[r]
me lying in bed like this every other day, but I honestly[r]
hope you don't push yourself too hard.[pcm]

"Since the case has been resolved, I hope you don't overwork[r]
yourself and end up dying from exhaustion. It would be a[r]
waste and it would also give me a bad feeling."[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__26.ogg"]
"Do you know who it is?"[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
"That too... Honestly, it's just a lot of unclear things.[r]
I'm starting to not even know if a person named Otsu Akiharu[r]
actually existed."[pcm]

Detective Natsuno, who let out a deep sigh, seemed to have[r]
an air of resignation... or rather, an air of trying not to[r]
think too deeply.[pcm]

The vice principal of Yamiya Academy, Otsu Akiharu, who was[r]
in a leading position in the incident, disappeared suddenly[r]
after escaping from that public restroom. It has been three[r]
weeks since then, and there has been no trace of him.[pcm]

Detective Natsuno seems to indicate that there has been[r]
little progress in the investigation, despite considering[r]
the possibility of fleeing abroad.[pcm]

"Moreover, the identity of Otsu, who is still unknown, has[r]
become even more complicated by the discovery of the body of[r]
a middle-aged man found in the basement during the search of[r]
his home conducted as part of the investigation."[pcm]

The identity of the body, which was determined through[r]
various examinations, is Otsu Akiharu. ...It has been[r]
approximately three years since his death, and it was[r]
already completely skeletal. The cause of death is unknown,[r]
but there is a possibility of poisoning based on the[r]
residue.[pcm]

A skeletal corpse, determined to be Otsu, who had been[r]
missing for three years, was found in the basement of Otsu's[r]
escaped home...[pcm]

If we use our imagination, various delusions are possible,[r]
but if we take this fact straight, it means that the man I[r]
met, named Otsu, was a completely different person who[r]
impersonated the vice principal of Yamiya Academy, Otsu[r]
Akiharu.[pcm]

"It may explain why a man who had been quietly working as a[r]
teacher suddenly got involved in heinous crimes such as[r]
human trafficking... However, there are still questions[r]
about the circumstances of the switch, and why no one around[r]
noticed the substitution at all."[pcm]

"Indeed, he was a man who could transform into such a[r]
'monster'. If someone were to say that he could transform[r]
into anyone, I wouldn't be able to deny it. Honestly, even I[r]
can't be confident whether that figure that remains in the[r]
corner of my memory was real or not."[pcm]

It was a situation that was too detached from reality... If[r]
there were no testimonies from others, I wouldn't doubt that[r]
it was a hallucination caused by the drugs I was forced to[r]
inhale.[pcm]

"However, I have kept the information about him[r]
'transforming' a secret from Detective Natsuno. It's such a[r]
detached from reality story, and both Emma and I have been[r]
strongly requested to keep it confidential by the Temperance[r]
Unit."[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
"How are you feeling, Shina-san? Your complexion seems to[r]
have improved quite a bit."[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__27.ogg"]
"Thanks to you, I managed somehow... I'm already getting a[r]
headache thinking about what to write in the report for this[r]
matter."[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
"We both have our fair share of troubles, don't we?"[pcm]

"Ha ha, Detective Natsuno weakly laughs... I owe him a few[r]
favors."[pcm]

My main job... being an agent of an investigation company,[r]
and the fact that I infiltrated the school under the guise[r]
of a teacher as part of my mission, I owe a great debt for[r]
most of the issues being overlooked.[pcm]

"Ideally, there could have been a situation where the legal[r]
department of the headquarters and the Japanese police and[r]
prosecutors would have been in a heated argument over how to[r]
handle me, which is something I don't even want to think[r]
about. But thanks to that, at least for now, I can focus on[r]
recovering. I am sincerely grateful for this."[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
"If I delve too much into it, it might become sexual[r]
harassment, so I'll refrain from doing so. Please take care[r]
not to push yourself too hard. It would be a source of hope[r]
for people like us, if someone like you, Shina-san, stays[r]
healthy."[pcm]

Detective Natsuno often refers to himself as a fool.[r]
However... honestly, I don't think so. I continued to pursue[r]
the missing persons case without succumbing to the bribes[r]
from Otsu and others. The fact that I survived is also[r]
thanks to this person who clung to the case.[pcm]

"He may be foolish in a negative sense, but in a positive[r]
sense, he is straightforward. Despite his unimpressive[r]
appearance, I feel that he is a person with determination."[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c02s__28.ogg"]

You have really bad eye bags."[pcm]

[夏野刑事]
"I will handle it. ...I really want to lie down and sleep[r]
soon. In that regard, I truly envy you, Shina-san."[pcm]

I chuckled at Detective Natsuno, who sighed and slumped his[r]
shoulders.[pcm]

The color of the autumn-like sky outside the window was[r]
dazzling when I shifted my gaze to the scenery.[pcm]

Emma was also hospitalized in the same hospital for three[r]

Emma's voice sounds tense... but at the same time, I can[r]
