[音楽 file = "【BGM】後味悪く.ogg"]
[環境音 file = "【SE】シャワー.ogg" loop = "true"]

Morning.[pcm]

I wake up... Well, I didn't sleep deeply...[l][er]
I head straight to the bathroom and take a shower.[pcm]

[カットイン file = "【カットイン】a02シャワーシーン1.png"]

I was organizing the situation so far while receiving the hottest water on my[r]head and back.[pcm]

The vice principal Otsu and the swimming club advisor[r]Sakagawa, who were designated as surveillance targets, are[r]in cahoots.[l][er]
There is no doubt about it.[pcm]

There was no time to confirm, and even if I asked, it's[r]doubtful if I would get a proper response.[l][er]
The fact that all the missing students are from the swimming club is not a[r]coincidence, but rather a result of Sakagawa being the connection.[pcm]

Moreover, considering his remarks about embracing Emma...[l][er]
It's not entirely impossible to think that it was a lie to[r]torment me, but with that appearance and demeanor.[l][er]
There is a good possibility that he was skillfully deceiving female students.[pcm]

Even though the specific level of danger regarding Emma being held hostage was[r]unclear, if that girl already had feelings for Sakagawa or was in a dependent[r]state, then the situation would be much more dangerous than I had thought.[pcm]

If it means being toyed with, it's still better...[l][er]
If the disappearances of the other female students were really due to human[r]trafficking, it's possible that they would disappear in no time.[pcm]

These assumptions could all be bluffs, of course.[l][er]
However, even if the situation surrounding Emma was an exaggeration or a bluff,[r]the fact remains that four female students are still missing after their[r]disappearance.[pcm]

.....[pcm]

Absolutely.[pcm]

It is absolutely certain that in the current situation, it is better to seek[r]help from outside.[pcm]

However, among the various options they had, they have[r]already discovered the fact that I am staying at this hotel.[l][er]
In other words, it means that I have already been under surveillance even before[r]infiltrating the school.[pcm]

The fact that I chose this hotel first was not just a coincidence or a[r]predetermined action, assuming that some of the undercover hotels prepared by[r]the client had already been somehow known to the other side.[pcm]

The situation of accurately probing that cannot be dismissed[r]as a coincidence.[l][er]
It is certain that both me and the client have been targeted even before this[r]mission began.[pcm]

[カットイン file = "【カットイン】a02シャワーシーン3.png"]

This room... no, even this shower room could be under[r]surveillance or being eavesdropped on.[l][er]
No, I must act with such awareness and sense of crisis.[pcm]

Asking for help... Headquarters?[l][er]
Even if I were to call for backup now, how would I do it?[l][er]
Those two contact persons from the client...[l][er]
No, if the client has already been targeted by them, it would not only be of no[r]help but also a quagmire.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__01.ogg"]
I have to do something... somehow...[pcm]

Whispering repeatedly, I tightly clench my fist.[l][er]
... Of course, there won't be any good ideas coming to mind.[pcm]

…[pcm]… ……[pcm]… …… ………[pcm][音楽 file = "【BGM】授業.ogg"]
[会話シーン file = "【背景】教室(昼).png"]

I head to school, unable to escape or prepare to fight, with[r]a gloomy mood, and act as a teacher.[l][er]
Today, there are only two classes in total.[l][er]
Since they are third-year students preparing for exams, it's an easy lesson.[pcm]

The class I serve as the assistant homeroom teacher for...[l][er]
is Emma's class.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_普通.png"]

While tracing the contents of the class displayed on the[r]smart glasses, I occasionally catch a glimpse of Emma's[r]state...[l][er]
She doesn't seem particularly different and is taking notes and approaching the[r]class in a very ordinary manner.[pcm]

The student seems to have some kind of emotion towards me,[r]or at least that's how it appears...[l][er]
She is calm, composed, and very serious...[l][er]
That's the atmosphere she gives off.[pcm]

[人物消去]

That girl and Sakagawa...? Was that story true...?[pcm]

I felt a heavy surge of indescribable emotions as the frivolous expression and[r]words of Sakagawa flashed through my mind.[pcm]

[音楽フェードアウト time = "1000"]

…[pcm]… ……[pcm]… …… ………[pcm][音楽 file = "【BGM】仕事.ogg"]
[会話シーン file = "【背景】職員室(昼).png"]

After finishing the class quota, I return to the staff room.[l][er]
While politely greeting the teachers, I check inside the staff room, but I don't[r]see the figures of Sakagawa or Otsu.[pcm]

[数学教師]
Good work, Teacher Shina. Are you getting used to it?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_やれやれ.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__02.ogg"]
Good work! Ahaha, I'm still quite nervous.[l][er]
Do you happen to know where Mr.[l][er]
Haruta is? I have something I want to ask...[pcm]

[人物消去]

[数学教師]
Are you looking for Mr. Haruta?[l][er]
I believe he was here just a moment ago...[l][er]
If you're in a hurry, should I make an announcement over the school broadcast?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_やあ！.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__03.ogg"]
Ah, no, I'm fine![pcm]

[人物消去]

It seems that Haruta is not here...[l][er]
Yes, Haruta. How should I perceive that old man?[l][er]
Since he is on the surveillance target list, there must be something suspicious[r]about him...[pcm]

However, it is also suspicious whether they are truly allies[r]of Otsu.[l][er]
This is because since Sakagawa suddenly revealed his personal circumstances, it[r]doesn't seem like there would be much reason for them to hide anything.[pcm]

In other words, their actions towards me are not just[r]'concealment,' but rather 'intimidation' or 'pressure'...[l][er]
In short, it means they are more inclined towards attacking[r]rather than fleeing.[l][er]
If that's the case, there is almost no reason for Haruta to hide his connection[r]with Otsu from me.[pcm]

If I were to take advantage of my position as the grade[r]level coordinator, I should be able to be constantly by her[r]side much more naturally than Sakagawa...[l][er]
What kind of perspective should I have in this situation...?[pcm]

A man enters the staff room as I try to put my thoughts into[r]the upcoming actions, placing the textbooks and reference[r]books that I had been carrying on the prepared desk...[l][er]
Well, these are just props that I won't use at all...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

He doesn't look like a teacher at all.[l][er]
He has a shaved head and a tall stature that seems to be[r]around 190cm.[l][er]
He's wearing a worn-out Y-shirt, carrying a jacket under his arm, and his tie is[r]sloppy...[pcm]

He is someone I've never seen before, but the teachers who[r]happened to be there are all bowing and saying 'Good work'[r]to the man.[l][er]
The man also casually bows his head and says 'Thank you, thank you' with a[r]relaxed gesture...[pcm]

[人物消去]

As I was scrutinizing him, wondering who he was, the man noticed my gaze and our[r]eyes met.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[？？？]
He is a teacher I've never seen before...[l][er]
Maybe he's the part-time staff I heard about the other day.[pcm]

The voice had a lack of tension, almost as if it was tired[r]or dragging.[l][er]
I quickly stood up and bowed. I didn't know who it was, but I felt the need to[r]put on a facade.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_喜.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__04.ogg"]
I have been working part-time since the other day.[l][er]
Nice to meet you, Satomi Shina.[pcm]

[人物消去]

In response to my reserved words, the man nodded and said,[r]'Ah, how polite...[l][er]
' and took out a business card from his pocket.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[？？？]
Nice to meet you, I am this kind of person.[pcm]

[人物消去]

The business card I received says, Natsuno Taiji, Patrol[r]Officer, Yamiya Police Station, Living Safety Department...[l][er]
In other words, he's a detective.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__05.ogg"]
Natsuno... san?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野]
Ah, yes, it's 'Kano'. I'm sorry, it's hard to read.[l][er]
If you could remember someone with a difficult-to-read last name...[pcm]

[人物消去]

Detective Natsuno, who laughs with a relaxed demeanor...[l][er]
He doesn't seem like a very serious person, but it's easy to[r]guess why a detective is here.[l][er]
It must be related to a missing person case.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野]
You may already know, but I often come here due to some[r]minor incidents.[l][er]
I will make sure not to disturb your work, so please take[r]care of me.[l][er]
Thank you in advance.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_楽.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__06.ogg"]
No, the same goes for me... Thank you for your hard work.[pcm]

[人物消去]

I bowed my head to Detective Natsuno...[l][er]
I was feeling conflicted inside.[l][er]
I had been informed by Futaba on the first day that Otsu had been frequently[r]visiting the police due to some incident, but I didn't expect a detective to be[r]coming in and out.[pcm]

It doesn't seem like the type with much motivation...[l][er]
If they start suspecting my background, it could become[r]complicated.[l][er]
It's not necessary to be cautious when dealing with an ordinary person like a[r]teacher, but when it comes to a person in authority...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野]
Um, Satomi-sensei?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_楽.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__07.ogg"]
Ah, yes, I'm sorry...[pcm]

[人物消去]

I realized that I had been momentarily lost in thought in[r]front of Detective Natsuno and panicked, raising my voice.[l][er]
It's dangerous... behaving in a way that could attract[r]attention from someone who is cautious about not doing[r]anything strange.[l][er]
I need to be careful...[pcm]

Detective Natsuno, on the other hand...[l][er]
Hmm, he murmured quietly. ... Oops, I wonder if he's already suspicious of me...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野]
Um, how about some tea?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_イライラ.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__08.ogg"]
Huh!?[pcm]

[人物消去]

Detective Natsuno had a serious demeanor as I stumbled and attracted the[r]attention of everyone in the staff room.[pcm]

[音楽フェードアウト time = "1000"]
[フェードＯＮ type = "黒" time = "1000"]

…[pcm]… ……[pcm]… …… ………[pcm][音楽 file = "【BGM】夏野刑事のテーマ.ogg"]
[会話シーン file = "【背景】体育館前.png"]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野]
I'm sorry for surprising you...[l][er]
I've been going around and asking the teachers for information.[pcm]

[人物消去]

Detective Natsuno is sitting in the shade behind the school building, in front[r]of the gymnasium parking space, lifting the pull tab of a canned coffee.[pcm]

I was completely taken aback when he suddenly invited me for tea, but as he[r]said, it seems that teachers have been invited like this before, and the other[r]teachers in the staff room laughed and sent me off, saying 'Don't worry about[r]it.[pcm]
'[pcm][人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_楽2.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__09.ogg"]
I was surprised because it was the first time I was hit on by a detective.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野]
Haha, if it's not work-related, that kind of thing is fine[r]too.[l][er]
But lately, I feel like I've completely withered...[pcm]

[人物消去]

The movement of stirring the canned coffee lacks brilliance.[l][er]
It gives off a feeling of exhaustion.[l][er]
... I guess he's in his mid-40s.[l][er]
There's a sense of busyness that somehow comes across.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野]
What does the teacher know about the disappearance case?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_どうしようか.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__10.ogg"]
I know everything that has been reported...[pcm]

[人物消去]

Detective Natsuno cleared his throat with a Hmm when I responded without causing[r]any trouble, as I couldn't answer that there was a suspicion of human[r]trafficking.[pcm]

What... No, I shouldn't overthink it.[l][er]
Judging from the teachers' reactions, he is a genuine detective, so it wouldn't[r]be fun to be suspiciously scrutinized.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野]
Well, that's true... There are things that haven't been covered in the media,[r]and there are teachers who know and teachers who don't know.[pcm]

[人物消去]

Detective Natsuno quickly gulped down the canned coffee and[r]placed the empty can beside him.[l][er]
... The air seemed to tighten slightly.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野]
I would like to keep this off the record because it's not[r]something that can be made public...[l][er]
but we believe it's not a normal missing person case.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__11.ogg"]
What... What does that mean...?[pcm]

Acting and true feelings, unintentionally, words that match[r]leaked out.[l][er]
What kind of conversation is this...?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野]
We can't trace the whereabouts of the missing students, it's[r]unnaturally difficult.[l][er]
Normally, there would be some traces left somewhere, like on[r]security cameras or social media.[l][er]
If we search, there should be at least some small traces before or after their[r]disappearance.[pcm]

[夏野]
This time, all four of them disappeared without a trace[r]after their disappearance.[l][er]
It's a rather peculiar situation in modern society.[l][er]
Especially in this town. Well, if they say it's the limit of our incompetent[r]local police, then so be it.[pcm]

[人物消去]

Detective Natsuno weakly chuckled.[l][er]
... How should I react? Or rather, what kind of situation is this?[pcm]

Detective Natsuno said, There are teachers who know and teachers who don't know,[r]so he must be choosing who to talk to...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__12.ogg"]
I don't understand why you're telling me this...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野]
Don't you understand?[pcm]

Detective Natsuno evades my question, but his expression and gaze were[r]different.[pcm]

In the eyes that were relaxed and exhausted just a moment[r]ago, there is something sharp dwelling within.[l][er]
It's as if he can see right through my true identity...[pcm]

[人物消去]

…[pcm]Calm down... Calm down. Think rationally.[l][er]
There is no point in this detective testing me, even if he were part of the Otsu[r]group.[pcm]

It is pointless to try to deceive me, who is already being[r]threatened and pressured.[l][er]
I know that you are an undercover investigator without even[r]questioning your true identity.[l][er]
In other words, the possibility of you being part of the Otsu group is close to[r]zero.[pcm]

I can only think that they suspect me...[l][er]
In other words, they are directing suspicious glances[r]towards me as a collaborator in the disappearance case, or[r]something along those lines...[l][er]
But when it comes to this, I myself only know about the possibility of human[r]trafficking.[pcm]

In other words, it's better not to try to hide anything...[l][er]
There's nothing to hide... Just play the role of a part-time[r]lecturer, that's it.[l][er]
Don't think about anything else.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_思案.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__13.ogg"]
For example, do you want me to cooperate with the investigation?[pcm]

[人物消去]

Detective Natsuno, who had been staring at me, widened his eyes for a moment and[r]let out a sigh.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野]
Oh, well... I'm sorry. Um, it's just that there are fewer[r]young ladies around.[l][er]
So, please be careful, Satomi-sensei.[l][er]
It's that kind of conversation.[l][er]
If I were to confess, there's a high possibility of it being considered a crime.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_思案.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__14.ogg"]
Is it a criminal case...?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野]
Yes... well, it's just speculation, but...[l][er]
Sensei...[pcm]

[人物消去]

Detective Natsuno hesitates again, and I tilt my head.[l][er]
We should have gotten past the previous question and[r]answer...[l][er]
but...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野]
Are you living in Yamiya all this time, Sensei?[pcm]

It seems like this detective is definitely suspicious of[r]something about me.[l][er]
He is definitely someone I should be cautious of.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_基本.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__15.ogg"]
No, when I was a student, I lived in Yamiya, but after that, I've been moving[r]around, like overseas or Tokyo.[pcm]

[人物消去]

I have a strong intuition that it's better not to try to[r]hide anything...[l][er]
It's a good thing I thoroughly corrected my identity to be[r]as close to my true self as possible before taking on this[r]mission.[l][er]
The atmosphere here feels like if I were to clumsily deceive, it would only lead[r]to further scrutiny.[pcm]

As for my occupation, it is a fact that I have been moving[r]around various places.[l][er]
There is no need to pretend. Detective Natsuno also seems to be convinced by my[r]demeanor, as he puts his hand on his mouth and says, 'Hmm...   '[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野]
This town has undergone quite a redevelopment, especially in[r]the downtown area.[l][er]
Several large buildings have been built.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_楽.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__16.ogg"]
Hmm... Yes, I was surprised. The atmosphere changed completely.[pcm]

[人物消去]

The distant view of the town I saw on the highway comes to[r]mind.[l][er]
It has certainly become a much bigger city compared to when I was a student.[pcm]

[音楽 file = "【BGM】疑惑.ogg"]
[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野]
Well, it's because they actively started attracting foreign[r]companies about 7 or 8 years ago, so even someone like me[r]who has been living here for a long time is surprised.[l][er]
And, well, with the increase of people working in finance and foreigners working[r]for foreign companies, security measures have also been significantly[r]strengthened.[pcm]

[夏野]
There are surveillance cameras and all sorts of things[r]everywhere...[l][er]
Before, there were only cameras like convenience store and dash cams, but now,[r]if you inquire with the neighborhood association or security companies, you can[r]easily get access to camera footage.[pcm]

[人物消去]

Detective Natsuno's words are momentarily difficult to[r]understand...[l][er]
but, most likely, this is a confirmation.[l][er]
It's probably the continuation of the conversation we had earlier about the four[r]missing persons' traces not being found unnaturally.[pcm]

By the way, he also mentioned something like 'especially in[r]this town, there is something strange.[l][er]
' He was talking about the uniqueness of surveillance cameras and security[r]measures in Yamiya.[pcm]

This talk about the security situation was news to me...[l][er]
But if it's true that there are no traces to follow in such a situation, it[r]would explain the suspicion of unnatural disappearances.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_思案.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__17.ogg"]
Is there a possibility of foul play in cases where the whereabouts are unknown[r]under such circumstances...?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野]
Well, that's about it... You really didn't know?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_哀.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__18.ogg"]
Yes, I'm sorry...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野]
No, no... I'm sorry too, it feels like an interrogation.[l][er]
Well, it's because of this situation...[l][er]
I was also surprised when someone like you suddenly came to work here.[pcm]

[人物消去]

This transparent... or is it acting?[l][er]
I really can't understand his subtle tone.[l][er]
He may not have that sharp gaze like earlier...[l][er]
but this man is quite difficult.[l][er]
Even with just a few words, it's impossible to guess what his true intentions[r]are.[pcm]

Detective Natsuno stretches out, making me more wary.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】夏野刑事.png"]

[夏野]
I apologize for talking for so long...[l][er]
Well, if you have any troubles, please feel free to tell me.[l][er]
When young people rely on us middle-aged folks, we tend to get enthusiastic.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】サトミ(教師服)_楽.png"]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__19.ogg"]
Yes, nice to meet you... I would prefer not to be a burden if possible.[pcm]

Detective Natsuno showed a relaxed smile and replied with a slightly heartfelt[r]response, saying, Well, of course.[pcm]

Late at night.[pcm]

I, who had returned to the hotel, was called by Otsu.[l][er]
The location was the school.[pcm]

I understood the purpose of being called without needing to ask for details, and[r]I had already made up my mind.[pcm]

Stripped half-naked and pushed down onto the desk, with a[r]ball gag in my mouth.[l][er]
... I can still breathe, but I can't swallow saliva, so it drips messily from my[r]mouth and it feels disgusting.[pcm]

Above all, I am completely immobilized by the handcuffs on[r]my hands and feet.[l][er]
It is even difficult to turn my gaze towards Otsu standing behind me.[pcm]

[大津]
It seems like you were talking with that detective during the day.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__21.ogg"]
Phew... Phew...[pcm]

Otsu's expression, looking down on me, is hardly visible due[r]to the angle and the darkness of the classroom.[l][er]
However, there is a mixture of anger in his voice.[l][er]
... It seems that he is quite displeased with the fact that the detective and I[r]made contact.[pcm]

[大津]
He's such an annoying man... Always following me around.[l][er]
Just being constantly called to the police station every single day is already a[r]nuisance.[pcm]

[効果音 file = "【SE】ぬちゅ１.ogg"]

Otsu's hand touches my buttocks and roughly gropes me, even[r]through my underwear.[l][er]
... He seems quite angry, and his rough handling is not so much about enjoying[r]my reaction, but rather venting his frustration.[pcm]

[大津]
I've been going around asking all the teachers here, digging[r]deep into their roots...[l][er]
even though I know nothing will come out.[l][er]
That's why it's even more annoying...[l][er]
What on earth did they tell you?[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__22.ogg"]
Huh, guh...... ugh......[pcm]

Otsu's rough touch from my buttocks to my groin...[l][er]
as he roughly handles my delicate parts.[l][er]
I involuntarily recoil, and Otsu lets out a growl.[pcm]

[イベント絵表示 file = "【イベントCG】a02_02.bmp"]

[大津]
Well, it doesn't matter... You should understand, don't get[r]any strange ideas.[l][er]
Your little sister can always be 'erased'.[l][er]
Of course, the same goes for you.[pcm]

While saying that, Otsu puts his hand on my underwear.[l][er]
My intimate parts being exposed...[l][er]
I came prepared, but it's still scary...[pcm]

[大津]
As long as you continue to entertain me, I will spare your[r]life.[l][er]

At most, until this place becomes completely useless and unusable...[pcm]

Ugh, fuu, uuugh, ngngngngggh!![pcm]
☆[pcm]Otsu's fingers spread open my secret lips and enter my[r]vagina...[l][er]
A powerful pleasure, as if my nerves are exposed and being touched directly,[r]travels up my spine and bursts at the top of my head...![pcm]

[大津]
Completely ignore that detective.[l][er]
Don't answer anything, no matter what you're asked.[l][er]
I'll say it again. If you show even the slightest suspicious[r]behavior, both you and your sister will be 'erased'[r]immediately.[l][er]
Do you understand?[pcm]

[voice file = "a02s__25.ogg"]
Huh, fuu, nnn, guh, uuuu!![pcm]
☆[pcm]The fingers rampage inside my vagina, making a squelching[r]sound.[l][er]

☆[pcm]I desperately nod my head in response, but honestly, that's[r]not the point.[l][er]
Even though it's just his fingers inside me, my sexual sensations are[r]intensifying at an incredible speed.[pcm]

What is this really... drugs? Or some kind of hypnosis?[l][er]
I don't understand what is being done to my body, it's scary...!![pcm]

[大津]
Heh, this vagina that eagerly bites like a teenager.[l][er]
Sakagawa-kun also praised it. I'll have to put in some effort so that I won't be[r]taken by him either.[pcm]

With a squelching sound, Otsu's fingers were pulled out, and[r]I had already reached climax.[l][er]
It was a light and shallow one, just from having his fingers inside me, but it[r]felt so intense...[pcm]

Otsu, who had lowered his pants, exposed his erect member pointing straight up[r]at a right angle, and pressed it against my defenseless crotch.[pcm]

[voice file = "a02s__28.ogg"]
Wow... amazing... what a size...[pcm]

When I was violated for the first time, I couldn't face[r]Otsu's penis due to the flow of the situation, the chaos,[r]and above all, being attacked from behind...[l][er]
Just catching a glimpse of it at the corner of my vision, I tremble at its size.[pcm]

That is going inside me from now on...[pcm]

And then, once it's settled, I'll take care of that guy too!![pcm]

The piston of Otsu is getting rougher and rougher...[l][er]
All the frustration is being pounded into me, it's painful, it's tough...[pcm]
And yet,[pcm][サトミ]
[voice file = "a02s__35.ogg"]
(I-I'm going crazy... Why am I feeling this way...[l][er]
Just from being roughly thrust up...[l][er]

The sweet, unfamiliar scent, whether it's the smell of my[r]own sweat or the smell of my love juices, fills the air and[r]dominates my nostrils.[l][er]
My vision blurs, my brain melts...[l][er]

I will thoroughly dominate you, transforming you into a woman who begs me to[r]kneel and violate her!![pcm]

Otsu's hands firmly hold my waist, and the relentless piston presses against my[r]depths, weighing down on my uterus with no escape.[pcm]

I'll also make sure you have a good time like this.[pcm]

I found myself nodding without hesitation to Otsu's words.[l][er]
Even though I understood in my head that it was the worst kind of agreement, my[r]body reacted on its own.[pcm]

When violated, when my stomach is stirred up by this person,[r]I can't resist at all...[l][er]
My whole being is completely dominated by this person...[l][er]
