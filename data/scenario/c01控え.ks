c01 is a scenario where the part of a04 is replaced.[l][er]
The replacement lines in the following txt file.[l][er]
The script file progresses with c01.[pcm]

Replacement from line 183 to line 185[pcm]However, this alone is not enough...[l][er]
or rather, we cannot eliminate the danger.[l][er]
They will surely be closely monitoring Emma's home, the next[r]target.[l][er]
Even though it's early morning, if the whole family is taken away together, we[r]should definitely intervene.[pcm]

Replacement from line 200 to line 402[pcm][サトミ]
[voice file = "c01s__01.ogg"]
Sorry, I don't have time to explain in detail.[l][er]
Also, I've arranged for Detective Natsuno from Hachimiya Police Station to[r]contact you, so let's share information.[pcm]

On the other hand, the man responded with a displeased tone[r]after a long silence, saying 'I understand.[l][er]
'... It's not like the police suddenly showing up is a[r]pleasant situation for them either, but I hope they can[r]cooperate.[l][er]
It also affects my survival.[pcm]

I hung up the call and hurried towards the school...[l][er]
There is no time to waste.[pcm]

The third plan... that is solidarity with Detective Natsuno.[l][er]
When I talked to him yesterday, I confessed everything we[r]are going to do.[l][er]
... This is probably the only way to protect Emma.[pcm]

Detective Natsuno showed a lot of reluctance...[l][er]
However, he knows that we are in a situation where we have[r]no choice.[l][er]
In the end, he agreed to support us.[pcm]

And the final preparation to let Detective Natsuno know my whereabouts...[pcm]

Replacement from line 237 to line 210[pcm][払田]
You've come.[pcm]

I instinctively brace myself as if to say, Not only are you not surprised by my[r]appearance, but you also seem to know everything...[pcm]

Yes... Until the end, this person was the only uncertain[r]factor, unable to distinguish between friend and foe, a[r]subject of surveillance.[l][er]
I was so preoccupied with Otsu and Sakagawa that I had no[r]time to pay any attention...[l][er]
But the fact that they are appearing now, means that...[pcm]
[pcm]

[払田]
I've heard everything from Natsuno-kun...[l][er]
Let's hurry.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c01s__02.ogg"]
Yes?[pcm]

Unexpectedly, a name came up and I was dumbfounded.[l][er]
Natsuno- kun... Is it about Natsuno's niece, the detective?[l][er]
... No, that's not the name that should come up here.[pcm]

If that's the case, it must be about Detective Natsuno...[pcm]

[払田]
Hey, let's hurry. It's a race against time, right?[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c01s__03.ogg"]
Ah... Y-yes...[pcm]

What is going on... Slightly confused by the behavior of my former homeroom[r]teacher, I follow behind him and head towards the staff room.[pcm]

[払田]
Don't make a surprised face. ...[l][er]
Even I am surprised. When I thought my former student had[r]come back, they were secretly...[l][er]
I wondered what they were up to...[pcm]

Mr. Haraida, who is walking ahead, mutters...[l][er]
Did he actually suspect that I was doing something behind[r]the scenes?[l][er]
Or rather...[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c01s__04.ogg"]
Um... What exactly is Mr. Haraida?[pcm]

There's no time to chat, so he snorts and asks bluntly,[pcm][払田]
Natsuno-kun was one of my students when I first started[r]teaching.[l][er]
He asked me to help him investigate a disappearance case in[r]a discreet manner.[l][er]
Well, I was keeping an eye on Vice Principal Otsu.[pcm]

[払田]
However, even though I thought it was suspicious, I couldn't find any clues at[r]all, what a useless person...[pcm]

Finally, Mr. Haraida speaks with a self-deprecating tone...[l][er]
I'm curious about what happened to his sister, Emma, but[r]I've come to understand something.[l][er]
He was the one under surveillance.[pcm]

From the perspective of the Temperance Unit, it seems that[r]Mr.[l][er]
Haraida, who has been investigating Otsu's movements, was also able to observe[r]suspicious individuals.[pcm]

It's the worst-case scenario, where we have to consider the[r]possibility of an agent sent by a third-party investigative[r]agency.[l][er]
From an external perspective, it certainly looks suspicious.[pcm]

[払田]
You're planning to cross a dangerous bridge, huh?[l][er]
Honestly, both sisters...[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c01s__05.ogg"]
What happened to Emma?[pcm]

I tilt my head as they refer to us as sisters.[l][er]
While it is true that Emma is in a dangerous position, it[r]should be different from the situation where I am crossing a[r]dangerous bridge.[l][er]
What does it mean for us to be referred to as sisters together...?[pcm]

[払田]
I will explain later... So please come back safely.[l][er]
I understand that they are a formidable opponent.[l][er]
Don't push yourself too hard, okay?[pcm]

There is no reason for me to turn around or stop here.[l][er]
Although spoken while walking briskly, Mr.[l][er]
Haraida's profile was serious, with a sense of gravity etched into it.[pcm]

... Maybe I didn't have a good eye for it, myself.[pcm]

We arrived at the staff room while doing so.[l][er]
Mr. Haraida opened the sliding door and when we entered, it[r]was empty...[l][er]
Convenient.[pcm]

We hurriedly make our way to the back of the staff room.[l][er]
... That seat of Otsu's that ultimately couldn't be[r]investigated that day.[l][er]
The desk is still neatly organized as usual.[pcm]

I immediately put my hand on the binder on the desk.[l][er]
With my smartphone in one hand, I quickly flipped through it on the desk.[pcm]

High-speed scanning... In other words, it is a function that[r]rapidly records the contents of files and binders using[r]continuous shooting.[l][er]
This itself is nothing special, as it is a feature found in ordinary apps for[r]the general public.[pcm]

The most important feature of this proprietary developed app is the access[r]function to the accompanying cloud storage.[pcm]

The data is instantly spread and transferred to the large servers owned by Augen[r]und Ohr, and this smartphone itself can send image data to clients without[r]leaving any image data on the device.[pcm]

The recipients to whom I am sending the image information now are, needless to[r]say, a duo with the Temperance Unit.[pcm]

[払田]
What are you doing?[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c01s__06.ogg"]
Sending image data externally.[pcm]

[払田]
Sending... Isn't this just a list of staff members?[l][er]
It has no relation to the disappearance case...[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c01s__07.ogg"]
I suppose so. Even if this image itself doesn't have any[r]meaning, it's fine.[l][er]
The important thing is if those guys start doubting what I'm doing...[pcm]

Yes... Even if this binder, no, all the other binders and files, everything on[r]Otsu's desk, may not be enough evidence of their crime, it's not a big problem.[pcm]

Clearly, it's not something that belongs to a teacher who[r]commutes regularly...[l][er]
The time has finally come. I secretly prepare myself.[pcm]

[坂川]
What are you doing?[pcm]

With a loud bang, the sliding door was forcefully opened and[r]the person who entered the staff room was, as I expected,[r]Sakagawa.[l][er]
... His expression was filled with confusion and impatience.[l][er]
It's quite satisfying.[pcm]

[払田]
... Is he also 'that'?[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c01s__08.ogg"]
That's what it means.[pcm]

When I confirmed that Sakagawa is part of Otsu's group, Teacher Hattada's[r]expression became even more stern.[pcm]

Sakagawa approaches here with an aura of anger...[l][er]
Full of determination. Despite knowing that Teacher Hattada is here, he shows no[r]hesitation in his approach.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c01s__09.ogg"]
Good morning, Sakagawa-sensei.[l][er]
You were quite late, were you sleeping by any chance?[pcm]

[坂川]
Shut up...! Do you know what will happen if you do something like this...[pcm]

Sakagawa, with a momentum as if he's about to pounce, is blocked by Teacher[r]Hattada standing in front of him, hindering his approach towards me.[pcm]

[払田]
Sakagawa-kun!! Cut it out...[pcm]

Sakagawa glares at the shouting Hattada.[l][er]
Feeling the sudden surge of murderous intent, I unintentionally raise my voice,[r]but...[pcm]

[坂川]
Shut up, old man!![pcm]

Sakagawa roars and swings his fist.[l][er]
With a loud thud, Hattada's body staggers and blood splatters.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c01s__10.ogg"]
Teacher Hattada!![pcm]

Teacher Hattada, with a trembling body, manages to stand firm and his face turns[r]bright red with anger, not losing to Sakagawa.[pcm]

[払田]
This idiot!![pcm]

The large body jumps at Sakagawa and both of them fall to[r]the ground with force.[l][er]
It's a reckless move that clearly shows they're not used to fighting, but[r]Sakagawa couldn't handle the difference in size.[pcm]

[坂川]
Get away... Old man!! I'll kill you!![pcm]

[払田]
Satomi-kun!! Run away!![pcm]

Teacher Hattada's shout flew, and I instinctively started running.[pcm]

He fully understands the purpose of the strategy I discussed[r]with Detective Natsuno...[l][er]
That's why he threw himself at Sakagawa with reckless abandon.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c01s__11.ogg"]
I'm going!![pcm]

In order to at least convey my will to Teacher Hattada, I shouted at the top of[r]my lungs and rushed out of the staff room.[pcm]

Run, run...!![pcm]

※※Replace from line 416 to line 443※※[pcm]Satomi managed to catch Sakagawa off guard.[l][er]
I'm honestly worried about Teacher Hattada, but Sakagawa shouldn't have much[r]time to deal with him either.[pcm]

All attention is directed towards me...[l][er]
If there's any dealing to be done, I should be the first.[l][er]
I want to believe that Teacher Hattada won't be killed...[pcm]

I stopped the scanning app and threw my smartphone into the nearby canal.[pcm]

I'm sure I'm being recorded by some security camera[r]somewhere, but it would be best if I can buy some time until[r]it's picked up.[l][er]
All of my actions are just to buy time.[pcm]

Regarding the contents of the binder I scanned earlier, just like I told Teacher[r]Hattada, it's not like I believe it will be evidence of Otsu's crimes from the[r]beginning.[pcm]

If someone as foolish as to leave important evidence of a crime in such a place[r]exists, the police wouldn't have a hard time.[pcm]

I repeat, the important thing is to make them realize the fact that I am moving[r]despite Otsu's repeated warnings.[pcm]

Filming, throwing away the smartphone, and escaping from[r]Sakagawa by chance...[l][er]
All of these are preparations to attract their attention towards me.[pcm]

One hour, two hours... During that time, the Temperance Unit[r]safely escorts Emma and her uncle out of the city.[l][er]
If they can move outside the city and have protection, at[r]least Emma will be safe...[l][er]
I want to believe she is safe.[pcm]

And if I become the decoy...[pcm]
Detective Natsuno might also[pcm]find clues to their crimes...
