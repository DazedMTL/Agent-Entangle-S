c01 is a scenario where the part of a04 is replaced. The[r]
replacement lines in the following txt file. The script file[r]
progresses with c01.[pcm]

Replacement from line 183 to line 185[pcm]

However, this alone is not enough... or rather, we cannot[r]
eliminate the danger. They will surely be closely monitoring[r]
Emma's home, the next target. Even though it's early[r]
morning, if the whole family is taken away together, we[r]
should definitely intervene.[pcm]

Replacement from line 200 to line 402[pcm]

"Sorry, I don't have time to explain in detail. Also, I've[r]
arranged for Detective Natsuno from Hachimiya Police Station[r]
to contact you, so let's share information."[pcm]

"On the other hand, the man responded with a displeased tone[r]
after a long silence, saying 'I understand.'... It's not[r]
like the police suddenly showing up is a pleasant situation[r]
for them either, but I hope they can cooperate. It also[r]
affects my survival."[pcm]

I hung up the call and hurried towards the school... There[r]
is no time to waste.[pcm]

The third plan... that is solidarity with Detective Natsuno.[r]
When I talked to him yesterday, I confessed everything we[r]
are going to do. ... This is probably the only way to[r]
"protect" Emma.[pcm]

Detective Natsuno showed a lot of reluctance... However, he[r]
knows that we are in a situation where we have no choice. In[r]
the end, he agreed to support us.[pcm]

And the final preparation to let Detective Natsuno know my[r]
whereabouts...[pcm]

Replacement from line 237 to line 210[pcm]

[払田]
"You've come."[pcm]

I instinctively brace myself as if to say, "Not only are you[r]
not surprised by my appearance, but you also seem to know[r]
everything..."[pcm]

"Yes... Until the end, this person was the only uncertain[r]
factor, unable to distinguish between friend and foe, a[r]
subject of surveillance. I was so preoccupied with Otsu and[r]
Sakagawa that I had no time to pay any attention... But the[r]
fact that they are appearing now, means that... "[pcm]

[払田]
"I've heard everything from Natsuno-kun... Let's hurry."[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c01s__02.ogg"]
"Yes?"[pcm]

Unexpectedly, a name came up and I was dumbfounded. Natsuno-[r]
kun... Is it about Natsuno's niece, the detective? ... No,[r]
that's not the name that should come up here.[pcm]

If that's the case, it must be about Detective Natsuno...[pcm]

[払田]
"Hey, let's hurry. It's a race against time, right?"[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c01s__03.ogg"]
"Ah... Y-yes..."[pcm]

What is going on... Slightly confused by the behavior of my[r]
former homeroom teacher, I follow behind him and head[r]
towards the staff room.[pcm]

[払田]
"Don't make a surprised face. ...Even I am surprised. When I[r]
thought my former student had come back, they were[r]
secretly... I wondered what they were up to..."[pcm]

"Mr. Haraida, who is walking ahead, mutters... Did he[r]
actually suspect that I was doing something behind the[r]
scenes? Or rather..."[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c01s__04.ogg"]
"Um... What exactly is Mr. Haraida?"[pcm]

"There's no time to chat, so he snorts and asks bluntly,"[pcm]

[払田]
"Natsuno-kun was one of my students when I first started[r]
teaching. He asked me to help him investigate a[r]
disappearance case in a discreet manner. Well, I was keeping[r]
an eye on Vice Principal Otsu."[pcm]

[払田]
"However, even though I thought it was suspicious, I[r]
couldn't find any clues at all, what a useless person..."[pcm]

"Finally, Mr. Haraida speaks with a self-deprecating tone...[r]
I'm curious about what happened to his sister, Emma, but[r]
I've come to understand something. He was the one under[r]
surveillance."[pcm]

From the perspective of the Temperance Unit, it seems that[r]
Mr. Haraida, who has been investigating Otsu's movements,[r]
was also able to observe suspicious individuals.[pcm]

It's the worst-case scenario, where we have to consider the[r]
possibility of an agent sent by a third-party investigative[r]
agency. From an external perspective, it certainly looks[r]
suspicious.[pcm]

[払田]
"You're planning to cross a dangerous bridge, huh? Honestly,[r]
both sisters..."[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c01s__05.ogg"]
"What happened to Emma?"[pcm]

"I tilt my head as they refer to us as sisters. While it is[r]
true that Emma is in a dangerous position, it should be[r]
different from the situation where I am crossing a dangerous[r]
bridge. What does it mean for us to be referred to as[r]
sisters together...?"[pcm]

[払田]
"I will explain later... So please come back safely. I[r]
understand that they are a formidable opponent. Don't push[r]
yourself too hard, okay?"[pcm]

"There is no reason for me to turn around or stop here.[r]
Although spoken while walking briskly, Mr. Haraida's profile[r]
was serious, with a sense of gravity etched into it."[pcm]

"...Maybe I didn't have a good eye for it, myself."[pcm]

We arrived at the staff room while doing so. Mr. Haraida[r]
opened the sliding door and when we entered, it was empty...[r]
Convenient.[pcm]

We hurriedly make our way to the back of the staff room.[r]
...That seat of Otsu's that ultimately couldn't be[r]
investigated that day. The desk is still neatly organized as[r]
usual.[pcm]

I immediately put my hand on the binder on the desk. With my[r]
smartphone in one hand, I quickly flipped through it on the[r]
desk.[pcm]

High-speed scanning... In other words, it is a function that[r]
rapidly records the contents of files and binders using[r]
continuous shooting. This itself is nothing special, as it[r]
is a feature found in ordinary apps for the general public.[pcm]

The most important feature of this proprietary developed app[r]
is the access function to the accompanying cloud storage.[pcm]

The data is instantly spread and transferred to the large[r]
servers owned by Augen und Ohr, and this smartphone itself[r]
can send image data to clients without leaving any image[r]
data on the device.[pcm]

The recipients to whom I am sending the image information[r]
now are, needless to say, a duo with the Temperance Unit.[pcm]

[払田]
"What are you doing?"[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c01s__06.ogg"]
"Sending image data externally."[pcm]

[払田]
"Sending... Isn't this just a list of staff members? It has[r]
no relation to the disappearance case..."[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c01s__07.ogg"]
"I suppose so. Even if this image itself doesn't have any[r]
meaning, it's fine. The important thing is if those guys[r]
start doubting what I'm doing..."[pcm]

"Yes... Even if this binder, no, all the other binders and[r]
files, everything on Otsu's desk, may not be enough evidence[r]
of their crime, it's not a big problem."[pcm]

"Clearly, it's not something that belongs to a teacher who[r]
commutes regularly... The time has finally come. I secretly[r]
prepare myself."[pcm]

[坂川]
"What are you doing?"[pcm]

"With a loud bang, the sliding door was forcefully opened[r]
and the person who entered the staff room was, as I[r]
expected, Sakagawa. ...His expression was filled with[r]
confusion and impatience. It's quite satisfying."[pcm]

[払田]
"...Is he also 'that'?"[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c01s__08.ogg"]
"That's what it means."[pcm]

"When I confirmed that Sakagawa is part of Otsu's group,[r]
Teacher Hattada's expression became even more stern."[pcm]

Sakagawa approaches here with an aura of anger... Full of[r]
determination. Despite knowing that Teacher Hattada is here,[r]
he shows no hesitation in his approach.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c01s__09.ogg"]
"Good morning, Sakagawa-sensei. You were quite late, were[r]
you sleeping by any chance?"[pcm]

[坂川]
"Shut up...! Do you know what will happen if you do[r]
something like this..."[pcm]

Sakagawa, with a momentum as if he's about to pounce, is[r]
blocked by Teacher Hattada standing in front of him,[r]
hindering his approach towards me.[pcm]

[払田]
"Sakagawa-kun!! Cut it out..."[pcm]

"Sakagawa glares at the shouting Hattada. Feeling the sudden[r]
surge of murderous intent, I unintentionally raise my voice,[r]
but..."[pcm]

[坂川]
"Shut up, old man!!"[pcm]

Sakagawa roars and swings his fist. With a loud thud,[r]
Hattada's body staggers and blood splatters.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c01s__10.ogg"]
"Teacher Hattada!!"[pcm]

Teacher Hattada, with a trembling body, manages to stand[r]
firm and his face turns bright red with anger, not losing to[r]
Sakagawa.[pcm]

[払田]
"This idiot!!"[pcm]

The large body jumps at Sakagawa and both of them fall to[r]
the ground with force. It's a reckless move that clearly[r]
shows they're not used to fighting, but Sakagawa couldn't[r]
handle the difference in size.[pcm]

[坂川]
"Get away... Old man!! I'll kill you!!"[pcm]

[払田]
"Satomi-kun!! Run away!!"[pcm]

"Teacher Hattada's shout flew, and I instinctively started[r]
running."[pcm]

He fully understands the purpose of the strategy I discussed[r]
with Detective Natsuno... That's why he threw himself at[r]
Sakagawa with reckless abandon.[pcm]

[サトミ]
[voice file = "c01s__11.ogg"]
"I'm going!!"[pcm]

"In order to at least convey my will to Teacher Hattada, I[r]
shouted at the top of my lungs and rushed out of the staff[r]
room."[pcm]

Run, run...!![pcm]

※※Replace from line 416 to line 443※※[pcm]

Satomi managed to catch Sakagawa off guard. I'm honestly[r]
worried about Teacher Hattada, but Sakagawa shouldn't have[r]
much time to deal with him either.[pcm]

"All attention is directed towards me... If there's any dealing[r]
to be done, I should be the first. I want to believe that[r]
Teacher Hattada won't be killed..."[pcm]

I stopped the scanning app and threw my smartphone into the[r]
nearby canal.[pcm]

"I'm sure I'm being recorded by some security camera[r]
somewhere, but it would be best if I can buy some time until[r]
it's picked up. All of my actions are just to buy time."[pcm]

"Regarding the contents of the binder I scanned earlier,[r]
just like I told Teacher Hattada, it's not like I believe it[r]
will be evidence of Otsu's crimes from the beginning."[pcm]

If someone as foolish as to leave important evidence of a[r]
crime in such a place exists, the police wouldn't have a[r]
hard time.[pcm]

"I repeat, the important thing is to make them realize the[r]
fact that I am moving despite Otsu's repeated warnings."[pcm]

"Filming, throwing away the smartphone, and escaping from[r]
Sakagawa by chance... All of these are preparations to[r]
attract their attention towards me."[pcm]

"One hour, two hours... During that time, the Temperance[r]
Unit safely escorts Emma and her uncle out of the city. If[r]
they can move outside the city and have protection, at least[r]
Emma will be safe... I want to believe she is safe."[pcm]

And if I become the decoy... Detective Natsuno might also[r]
find clues to their crimes...
