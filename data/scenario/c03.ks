Before evening.[pcm]

The residential area of Nanasaki in Hachimiya City. With the[r]
convenience of the rapid commuting train, it takes only 20[r]
minutes to reach the center of Hachimiya, making it a prime[r]
location. The redevelopment in Hachimiya's center is[r]
progressing just as much as in other areas.[pcm]

The scale of the residential area in Nanasaki is larger and[r]
wider than that of Hachimiya City, and it is popular among[r]
people of all ages and genders.[pcm]

Emma was gazing absentmindedly at the sky in the park[r]
installed in front of the still new apartment building.[pcm]

[人物消去]

"Early in the morning, two men suddenly visited... Clearly[r]
suspicious, they informed Emma and her guardians, her aunt[r]
and uncle, about Satomi Shina's current status and position,[r]
and the reason for returning to Hachimiya, bringing them to[r]
Nanasaki."[pcm]

"Both Emma and her aunt and uncle honestly had reservations[r]
about the request of wanting to protect her until the[r]
situation with the suspicious incident settled down."[pcm]

"However, through the two men who protected Emma, Detective[r]
Natsuno from the Hachimiya Police Station... Natsuno Yoko's[r]
uncle... contacted them without delay, and his subordinate[r]
appeared to persuade them. Currently, they are in a standby[r]
state in Nanasaki for the time being."[pcm]

Emma's uncle and aunt are in a room on the upper floor of[r]
the apartment behind the park. There is one guard in the[r]
room. According to the men's explanation, he is said to be[r]
the "most skilled." For now, it seems that they can feel[r]
relieved...[pcm]

"A silver-haired woman with an otherworldly appearance...[r]
Her presence serves as proof of Satomi's seemingly[r]
unbelievable background as an agent of an overseas[r]
investigation company, which her uncle, aunt, and Emma[r]
couldn't help but accept."[pcm]

Emma, who is currently outside, has one guard accompanying[r]
her, not because she feels uncomfortable staying in the same[r]
room as her uncle and aunt, but because she couldn't stand[r]
still. However, Emma herself also felt a slight sense of[r]
unease towards that situation.[pcm]

Emma is standing near a girl who is wearing the same school-[r]
designated summer knit uniform as her in Hachimiya. She is[r]
petite, with braided hair and glasses, giving her an[r]
unassuming appearance... She has been standing at a certain[r]
distance from Emma all this time.[pcm]

(She's our student... right...)[pcm]

[人物消去]

"I have never spoken a word to her, and even since being[r]
brought here today, we haven't exchanged any words. However,[r]
Emma recognized that girl. Although they are in different[r]
classes, they are classmates... in other words, she should[r]
be a genuine student of Hachigaku, not in disguise."[pcm]

"It seems that she is not just an ordinary female student,[r]
considering that the two men and the silver-haired woman[r]
accompanying her aunt and uncle confidently asserted that[r]
they could entrust her with their protection."[pcm]

It seems that... the story is too far-fetched... that was[r]
Emma's honest feeling.[pcm]

"This might be a little dangerous..."[pcm]

Emma turned around upon hearing one of the two men, who were[r]
sitting on a bench in the park and engrossed in their[r]
smartphones, groaning.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_哀.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c03e__02.ogg"]
"What's wrong...?"[pcm]

Emma asked, and the overweight man... Devi groaned, "Hmm..."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】デヴィ_呆れ.png"]


[デヴィ]
"The whereabouts of your sister are a bit..."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ノッホ_基本.png"]

[ノッホ]
"Isn't that the infamous apartment?"[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】デヴィ_基本.png"]

[デヴィ]
"No, she's been moved... It seems like she was taken away[r]
before that detective could intervene. If things continue[r]
like this..."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_怒.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c03e__03.ogg"]
"Is my sister in danger!?"[pcm]

[人物消去]

Emma interrupts the conversation between the two men... in a[r]
surprisingly loud voice that even surprises herself. Devi[r]
and Nocho widen their eyes, but Emma pays no attention[r]
and...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_怒.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c03e__04.ogg"]
"Are those people who have abducted four people as[r]
opponents!? If you know it's dangerous, then hurry and[r]
help..."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ノッホ_呆れ.png"]

[ノッホ]
"Calm down, Emma-chan... That's why we need to be careful."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_怒.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c03e__05.ogg"]
"What will you do if something happens to my older sister?!"[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ノッホ_呆れ.png"]

[ノッホ]
"C-Calm down..."[pcm]

[人物消去]

Devi groaned as he was overwhelmed by Emma's intense[r]
expression, causing Nocho to almost fall backwards.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】デヴィ_基本.png"]

[デヴィ]
"Certainly, it may be a bit reckless, but it might come to[r]
the point of using force. It's also because of our request.[r]
Should we brace ourselves?"[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ノッホ_呆れ.png"]

[ノッホ]
"Is it okay? If it turns into a violent incident, the young[r]
lady will lose her position within the conglomerate again."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】デヴィ_基本.png"]

[デヴィ]
"There's no other way. We've been strictly ordered to do it[r]
when the time comes. ...Let's do it before it becomes[r]
irreparable."[pcm]

[人物消去]

Devi's words made Nocho easily agree, and he picked up his[r]
smartphone. He contacted the colleagues who were guarding[r]
Emma's uncle and aunt in the apartment, informing them that[r]
they would leave Nanasaki and resort to the use of force.[pcm]

"Realizing that these two are apparently heading to rescue[r]
Satomi, Emma confronts Devi and..."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_怒.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c03e__06.ogg"]
"Please take me with you too...!"[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】デヴィ_基本.png"]

[デヴィ]
"That won't do. Emma-chan, you need to stay quiet here..."[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_怒.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c03e__07.ogg"]
"Take me with you, please!!"[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】デヴィ&ノッホ_呆れ.png"]

Devi and Nocho, who were taken aback and hesitated, mumbled,[r]
"No, that wouldn't make sense..." as they were about to grab[r]
Devi's collar with a loud voice that echoed around them.[pcm]

[人物消去]

[クイーン]
[voice file = "c03q__01.ogg"]
"I'll go with you too. How about that?"[pcm]

The girl with braided hair suddenly stood behind Emma and[r]
said to the two of them. Devi and Nocho could only sigh[r]
deeply and nod their heads in response to her assertive and[r]
uncompromising attitude.[pcm]
