Before evening.[pcm]

The residential area of Nanasaki in Hachimiya City.[l][er]
With the convenience of the rapid commuting train, it takes[r]only 20 minutes to reach the center of Hachimiya, making it[r]a prime location.[l][er]
The redevelopment in Hachimiya's center is progressing just as much as in other[r]areas.[pcm]

The scale of the residential area in Nanasaki is larger and wider than that of[r]Hachimiya City, and it is popular among people of all ages and genders.[pcm]

Emma was gazing absentmindedly at the sky in the park installed in front of the[r]still new apartment building.[pcm]

[人物消去]

Early in the morning, two men suddenly visited...[l][er]
Clearly suspicious, they informed Emma and her guardians, her aunt and uncle,[r]about Satomi Shina's current status and position, and the reason for returning[r]to Hachimiya, bringing them to Nanasaki.[pcm]

Both Emma and her aunt and uncle honestly had reservations about the request of[r]wanting to protect her until the situation with the suspicious incident settled[r]down.[pcm]

However, through the two men who protected Emma, Detective[r]Natsuno from the Hachimiya Police Station...[l][er]
Natsuno Yoko's uncle... contacted them without delay, and[r]his subordinate appeared to persuade them.[l][er]
Currently, they are in a standby state in Nanasaki for the time being.[pcm]

Emma's uncle and aunt are in a room on the upper floor of[r]the apartment behind the park.[l][er]
There is one guard in the room.[l][er]
According to the men's explanation, he is said to be the[r]most skilled.[l][er]
For now, it seems that they can feel relieved...[pcm]

A silver-haired woman with an otherworldly appearance...[l][er]
Her presence serves as proof of Satomi's seemingly unbelievable background as an[r]agent of an overseas investigation company, which her uncle, aunt, and Emma[r]couldn't help but accept.[pcm]

Emma, who is currently outside, has one guard accompanying[r]her, not because she feels uncomfortable staying in the same[r]room as her uncle and aunt, but because she couldn't stand[r]still.[l][er]
However, Emma herself also felt a slight sense of unease towards that situation.[pcm]

Emma is standing near a girl who is wearing the same school-[r]designated summer knit uniform as her in Hachimiya.[l][er]
She is petite, with braided hair and glasses, giving her an[r]unassuming appearance...[l][er]
She has been standing at a certain distance from Emma all this time.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_哀.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c03e__01.ogg"]
(She's our student... right...)[pcm]

[人物消去]

I have never spoken a word to her, and even since being[r]brought here today, we haven't exchanged any words.[l][er]
However, Emma recognized that girl.[l][er]
Although they are in different classes, they are[r]classmates...[l][er]
in other words, she should be a genuine student of Hachigaku, not in disguise.[pcm]

It seems that she is not just an ordinary female student, considering that the[r]two men and the silver-haired woman accompanying her aunt and uncle confidently[r]asserted that they could entrust her with their protection.[pcm]

It seems that... the story is too far-fetched...[l][er]
that was Emma's honest feeling.[pcm]

This might be a little dangerous...[pcm]

[人物消去]

Emma turned around upon hearing one of the two men, who were sitting on a bench[r]in the park and engrossed in their smartphones, groaning.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_哀.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c03e__02.ogg"]
What's wrong...?[pcm]

[人物消去]

Emma asked, and the overweight man...[l][er]
Devi groaned, Hmm...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】デヴィ_呆れ.png"]


[デヴィ]
The whereabouts of your sister are a bit...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ノッホ_基本.png"]

[ノッホ]
Isn't that the infamous apartment?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】デヴィ_基本.png"]

[デヴィ]
No, she's been moved... It seems like she was taken away[r]before that detective could intervene.[l][er]
If things continue like this...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_怒.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c03e__03.ogg"]
Is my sister in danger!?[pcm]

[人物消去]

Emma interrupts the conversation between the two men...[l][er]
in a surprisingly loud voice that even surprises herself.[l][er]
Devi and Nocho widen their eyes, but Emma pays no attention and...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_怒.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c03e__04.ogg"]
Are those people who have abducted four people as[r]opponents!?[l][er]
If you know it's dangerous, then hurry and help...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ノッホ_呆れ.png"]

[ノッホ]
Calm down, Emma-chan... That's why we need to be careful.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_怒.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c03e__05.ogg"]
What will you do if something happens to my older sister?![pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ノッホ_呆れ.png"]

[ノッホ]
C-Calm down...[pcm]

[人物消去]

Devi groaned as he was overwhelmed by Emma's intense expression, causing Nocho[r]to almost fall backwards.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】デヴィ_基本.png"]

[デヴィ]
Certainly, it may be a bit reckless, but it might come to[r]the point of using force.[l][er]
It's also because of our request.[l][er]
Should we brace ourselves?[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】ノッホ_呆れ.png"]

[ノッホ]
Is it okay? If it turns into a violent incident, the young lady will lose her[r]position within the conglomerate again.[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】デヴィ_基本.png"]

[デヴィ]
There's no other way. We've been strictly ordered to do it[r]when the time comes.[l][er]
... Let's do it before it becomes irreparable.[pcm]

[人物消去]

Devi's words made Nocho easily agree, and he picked up his[r]smartphone.[l][er]
He contacted the colleagues who were guarding Emma's uncle and aunt in the[r]apartment, informing them that they would leave Nanasaki and resort to the use[r]of force.[pcm]

Realizing that these two are apparently heading to rescue Satomi, Emma confronts[r]Devi and...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_怒.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c03e__06.ogg"]
Please take me with you too...![pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】デヴィ_基本.png"]

[デヴィ]
That won't do. Emma-chan, you need to stay quiet here...[pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】エマ(制服)_怒.png"]

[エマ]
[voice file = "c03e__07.ogg"]
Take me with you, please!![pcm]

[人物 file = "【立ち絵】デヴィ&ノッホ_呆れ.png"]

Devi and Nocho, who were taken aback and hesitated, mumbled,[r]No, that wouldn't make sense...[l][er]
as they were about to grab Devi's collar with a loud voice that echoed around[r]them.[pcm]

[人物消去]

[クイーン]
[voice file = "c03q__01.ogg"]
I'll go with you too. How about that?[pcm]

The girl with braided hair suddenly stood behind Emma and[r]said to the two of them.[l][er]
Devi and Nocho could only sigh deeply and nod their heads in response to her[r]assertive and uncompromising attitude.[pcm]
